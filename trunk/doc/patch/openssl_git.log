    Disable SSLv2 default build, default negotiation and weak ciphers.
    
    SSLv2 is by default disabled at build-time.  Builds that are not
    configured with "enable-ssl2" will not support SSLv2.  Even if
    "enable-ssl2" is used, users who want to negotiate SSLv2 via the
    version-flexible SSLv23_method() will need to explicitly call either
    of:
    
        SSL_CTX_clear_options(ctx, SSL_OP_NO_SSLv2);
    or
        SSL_clear_options(ssl, SSL_OP_NO_SSLv2);
    
    as appropriate.  Even if either of those is used, or the application
    explicitly uses the version-specific SSLv2_method() or its client
    or server variants, SSLv2 ciphers vulnerable to exhaustive search
    key recovery have been removed.  Specifically, the SSLv2 40-bit
    EXPORT ciphers, and SSLv2 56-bit DES are no longer available.

    Fix BN_hex2bn/BN_dec2bn NULL ptr/heap corruption
    
    In the BN_hex2bn function the number of hex digits is calculated using
    an int value |i|. Later |bn_expand| is called with a value of |i * 4|.
    For large values of |i| this can result in |bn_expand| not allocating any
    memory because |i * 4| is negative. This leaves ret->d as NULL leading
    to a subsequent NULL ptr deref. For very large values of |i|, the
    calculation |i * 4| could be a positive value smaller than |i|. In this
    case memory is allocated to ret->d, but it is insufficiently sized
    leading to heap corruption. A similar issue exists in BN_dec2bn.
    
    This could have security consequences if BN_hex2bn/BN_dec2bn is ever
    called by user applications with very large untrusted hex/dec data. This is
    anticipated to be a rare occurrence.
    
    All OpenSSL internal usage of this function uses data that is not expected
    to be untrusted, e.g. config file data or application command line
    arguments. If user developed applications generate config file data based
    on untrusted data then it is possible that this could also lead to security
    consequences. This is also anticipated to be a rare.

    Fix memory issues in BIO_*printf functions
    
    The internal |fmtstr| function used in processing a "%s" format string
    in the BIO_*printf functions could overflow while calculating the length
    of a string and cause an OOB read when printing very long strings.
    
    Additionally the internal |doapr_outch| function can attempt to write to
    an OOB memory location (at an offset from the NULL pointer) in the event of
    a memory allocation failure. In 1.0.2 and below this could be caused where
    the size of a buffer to be allocated is greater than INT_MAX. E.g. this
    could be in processing a very long "%s" format string. Memory leaks can also
    occur.
    
    These issues will only occur on certain platforms where sizeof(size_t) >
    sizeof(int). E.g. many 64 bit systems. The first issue may mask the second
    issue dependent on compiler behaviour.
    
    These problems could enable attacks where large amounts of untrusted data
    is passed to the BIO_*printf functions. If applications use these functions
    in this way then they could be vulnerable. OpenSSL itself uses these
    functions when printing out human-readable dumps of ASN.1 data. Therefore
    applications that print this data could be vulnerable if the data is from
    untrusted sources. OpenSSL command line applications could also be
    vulnerable where they print out ASN.1 data, or if untrusted data is passed
    as command line arguments.
    
    Libssl is not considered directly vulnerable. Additionally certificates etc
    received via remote connections via libssl are also unlikely to be able to
    trigger these issues because of message size limits enforced within libssl.

    CVE-2016-0798: avoid memory leak in SRP
    
    The SRP user database lookup method SRP_VBASE_get_by_user had confusing
    memory management semantics; the returned pointer was sometimes newly
    allocated, and sometimes owned by the callee. The calling code has no
    way of distinguishing these two cases.
    
    Specifically, SRP servers that configure a secret seed to hide valid
    login information are vulnerable to a memory leak: an attacker
    connecting with an invalid username can cause a memory leak of around
    300 bytes per connection.
    
    Servers that do not configure SRP, or configure SRP but do not configure
    a seed are not vulnerable.
    
    In Apache, the seed directive is known as SSLSRPUnknownUserSeed.
    
    To mitigate the memory leak, the seed handling in SRP_VBASE_get_by_user
    is now disabled even if the user has configured a seed.
    
    Applications are advised to migrate to SRP_VBASE_get1_by_user. However,
    note that OpenSSL makes no strong guarantees about the
    indistinguishability of valid and invalid logins. In particular,
    computations are currently not carried out in constant time.

    RT4175: Fix PKCS7_verify() regression with Authenticode signatures
    
    This is a partial revert of commit c8491de39 ("GH354: Memory leak fixes"),
    which was cherry-picked from commit 55500ea7c in OpenSSL 1.1.
    
    That commit introduced a change in behaviour which is a regression for
    software implementing Microsoft Authenticode — which requires a PKCS#7
    signature to be validated against explicit external data, even though
    it's a non-detached signature with its own embedded data.
    
    The is fixed differently in OpenSSL 1.1 by commit 6b2ebe433 ("Add
    PKCS7_NO_DUAL_CONTENT flag"), but that approach isn't viable in the
    1.0.2 stable branch, so just comment the offending check back out again.

    Handle SSL_shutdown while in init more appropriately #2
    
    Previous commit f73c737c7 attempted to "fix" a problem with the way
    SSL_shutdown() behaved whilst in mid-handshake. The original behaviour had
    SSL_shutdown() return immediately having taken no action if called mid-
    handshake with a return value of 1 (meaning everything was shutdown
    successfully). In fact the shutdown has not been successful.
    
    Commit f73c737c7 changed that to send a close_notify anyway and then
    return. This seems to be causing some problems for some applications so
    perhaps a better (much simpler) approach is revert to the previous
    behaviour (no attempt at a shutdown), but return -1 (meaning the shutdown
    was not successful).
    
    This also fixes a bug where SSL_shutdown always returns 0 when shutdown
    *very* early in the handshake (i.e. we are still using SSLv23_method).

    Prevent small subgroup attacks on DH/DHE
    
    Historically OpenSSL only ever generated DH parameters based on "safe"
    primes. More recently (in version 1.0.2) support was provided for
    generating X9.42 style parameter files such as those required for RFC
    5114 support. The primes used in such files may not be "safe". Where an
    application is using DH configured with parameters based on primes that
    are not "safe" then an attacker could use this fact to find a peer's
    private DH exponent. This attack requires that the attacker complete
    multiple handshakes in which the peer uses the same DH exponent.
    
    A simple mitigation is to ensure that y^q (mod p) == 1

    Handle SSL_shutdown while in init more appropriately
    
    Calling SSL_shutdown while in init previously gave a "1" response, meaning
    everything was successfully closed down (even though it wasn't). Better is
    to send our close_notify, but fail when trying to receive one.
    
    The problem with doing a shutdown while in the middle of a handshake is
    that once our close_notify is sent we shouldn't really do anything else
    (including process handshake/CCS messages) until we've received a
    close_notify back from the peer. However the peer might send a CCS before
    acting on our close_notify - so we won't be able to read it because we're
    not acting on CCS messages!

    slistlen): the third parameter 'slistlen' not used in the substitution
    code; used 'clistlen' instead. As a result of this, compilation error
    occurs when any application uses this macro.

    The feature_test_macros(7) manual tells us that _BSD_SOURCE is
    deprecated since glibc 2.20 and that the compiler will warn about it
    being used, unless _DEFAULT_SOURCE is defined as well.

    Remove cookie validation return value trick
    
    In the DTLS ClientHello processing the return value is stored in |ret| which
    by default is -1. |ret| is only updated to a positive value once we are past
    all points where we could hit an error. We wish to return 1 on success or 2
    on success *and* we have validated the DTLS cookie. Previously on successful
    validation of the cookie we were setting |ret| to -2, and then once we were
    past all error points we set |ret = -ret|. This is non-obvious behaviour and
    could be error prone. This commit tries to make this a bit more intuitive.

    Good hygiene with size_t output argument.
    
    Though the callers check the function return value and ignore the
    size_t output argument on failure, it is still often not ideal to
    store -1 in a size_t on error.  That might signal an unduly large
    buffer.  Instead set the size_t to 0, to indicate no space.

    Stop DTLS servers asking for unsafe legacy renegotiation
    
    If a DTLS client that does not support secure renegotiation connects to an
    OpenSSL DTLS server then, by default, renegotiation is disabled. If a
    server application attempts to initiate a renegotiation then OpenSSL is
    supposed to prevent this. However due to a discrepancy between the TLS and
    DTLS code, the server sends a HelloRequest anyway in DTLS.
    
    This is not a security concern because the handshake will still fail later
    in the process when the client responds with a ClientHello.

    Only call ssl3_init_finished_mac once for DTLS
    
    In DTLS if an IO retry occurs during writing of a fragmented ClientHello
    then we can end up reseting the finish mac variables on the retry, which
    causes a handshake failure. We should only reset on the first attempt not
    on retries.

    Remove redundant check from tls1_get_curvelist
    
    The function tls1_get_curvelist() has an explicit check to see if s->cert
    is NULL or not. However the check appears *after* calling the tls1_suiteb
    macro which derefs s->cert. In reality s->cert can never be NULL because
    it is created in SSL_new(). If the malloc fails then the SSL_new call fails
    and no SSL object is created.

    Don't treat a bare OCTETSTRING as DigestInfo in int_rsa_verify
    
    The function int_rsa_verify is an internal function used for verifying an
    RSA signature. It takes an argument |dtype| which indicates the digest type
    that was used. Dependant on that digest type the processing of the
    signature data will vary. In particular if |dtype == NID_mdc2| and the
    signature data is a bare OCTETSTRING then it is treated differently to the
    default case where the signature data is treated as a DigestInfo (X509_SIG).
    
    Due to a missing "else" keyword the logic actually correctly processes the
    OCTETSTRING format signature first, and then attempts to continue and
    process it as DigestInfo. This will invariably fail because we already know
    that it is a bare OCTETSTRING.
    
    This failure doesn't actualy make a real difference because it ends up at
    the |err| label regardless and still returns a "success" result. This patch
    just cleans things up to make it look a bit more sane.

    Make BUF_strndup() read-safe on arbitrary inputs
    
    BUF_strndup was calling strlen through BUF_strlcpy, and ended up reading
    past the input if the input was not a C string.
    
    Make it explicitly part of BUF_strndup's contract to never read more
    than |siz| input bytes. This augments the standard strndup contract to
    be safer.
    
    The commit also adds a check for siz overflow and some brief documentation
    for BUF_strndup().

    RT3823: Improve the robustness of event logging
    
    There are a couple of minor fixes here:
    
    1) Handle the case when RegisterEventSource() fails (which it may for
    various reasons) and do the work of logging the event only if it succeeds.
    
    2) Handle the case when ReportEvent() fails and do our best in debug builds
    to at least attempt somehow indicate that something has gone wrong. The
    typical situation would be someone running tools like DbMon, DBWin32,
    DebugView or just having the debugger attached. The intent is to make sure
    that at least some data will be captured so that we can save hours and days
    of debugging time.
    
    3) Minor fix to change the MessageBox() flag to MB_ICONERROR. Though the
    value of MB_ICONERROR is the same value as MB_ICONSTOP, the intent is
    better conveyed by using MB_ICONERROR.
    
    Testing performed:
    
    1) Clean compilation for debug-VC-WIN32 and VC-WIN32.
    
    2) Good test results (nmake -f ms\ntdll.mak test) for debug-VC-WIN32 and
    VC-WIN32.
    
    3) Stepped through relevant changes using WinDBG and exercised the impacted
    code paths.

    Make sure OPENSSL_cleanse checks for NULL
    
    In master we have the function OPENSSL_clear_free(x,y), which immediately
    returns if x == NULL. In <=1.0.2 this function does not exist so we have to
    do:
    OPENSSL_cleanse(x, y);
    OPENSSL_free(x);
    
    However, previously, OPENSSL_cleanse did not check that if x == NULL, so
    the real equivalent check would have to be:
    if (x != NULL)
        OPENSSL_cleanse(x, y);
    OPENSSL_free(x);
    
    It would be easy to get this wrong during cherry-picking to other branches

    RT3757: base64 encoding bugs
    
    Rewrite EVP_DecodeUpdate.
    
    In particular: reject extra trailing padding, and padding in the middle
    of the content. Don't limit line length. Add tests.
    
    Previously, the behaviour was ill-defined, and depended on the position
    of the padding within the input.
    
    In addition, this appears to fix a possible two-byte oob read.

    Better handling of verify param id peername field
    
    Initialize pointers in param id by the book (explicit NULL assignment,
    rather than just memset 0).
    
    In x509_verify_param_zero() set peername to NULL after freeing it.
    
    In x509_vfy.c's internal check_hosts(), avoid potential leak of
    possibly already non-NULL peername.  This is only set when a check
    succeeds, so don't need to do this repeatedly in the loop.

    Commit f0348c842e7 introduced a problem with session resumption. The

    the creation of the session earlier in the process the version is fixed
    *before* version negotiation has completed when processing the ServerHello
    on the client side. This fix updates the session version after version neg
    has completed.

    Fix DTLS session ticket renewal
    
    A DTLS client will abort a handshake if the server attempts to renew the
    session ticket. This is caused by a state machine discrepancy between DTLS
    and TLS discovered during the state machine rewrite work.
    
    The bug can be demonstrated as follows:
    
    Start a DTLS s_server instance:
    openssl s_server -dtls
    
    Start a client and obtain a session but no ticket:
    openssl s_client -dtls -sess_out session.pem -no_ticket
    
    Now start a client reusing the session, but allow a ticket:
    openssl s_client -dtls -sess_in session.pem
    
    The client will abort the handshake.

    Fix "make test" seg fault with SCTP enabled
    
    When config'd with "sctp" running "make test" causes a seg fault. This is
    actually due to the way ssltest works - it dives under the covers and frees
    up BIOs manually and so some BIOs are NULL when the SCTP code does not
    expect it. The simplest fix is just to add some sanity checks to make sure
    the BIOs aren't NULL before we use them.
    
    This problem occurs in master and 1.0.2. The fix has also been applied to
    1.0.1 to keep the code in sync.

    Fix write failure handling in DTLS1.2
    
    The DTLS code is supposed to drop packets if we try to write them out but
    the underlying BIO write buffers are full. ssl3_write_pending() contains
    an incorrect test for DTLS that controls this. The test only checks for
    DTLS1 so DTLS1.2 does not correctly clear the internal OpenSSL buffer which
    can later cause an assert to be hit. This commit changes the test to cover
    all DTLS versions.

    Fix SSL_set_session_ticket_ext when used with SSLv23_method
    
    The function SSL_set_session_ticket_ext can be used to set custom session
    ticket data passed in the initial ClientHello. This can be particularly
    useful for EAP-FAST. However, when using SSLv23_method, the session does
    not get created until the ServerHello has been received. The extension code
    will only add the SessionTicket data to the ClientHello if a session already
    exists. Therefore SSL_set_session_ticket_ext has no impact when used in
    conjunction with SSLv23_method. The solution is to simply create the session
    during creation of the ClientHello instead of waiting for the ServerHello.
    
    This commit fixes the test failure introduced by the previous commit.

    Reject calls to X509_verify_cert that have not been reinitialised
    
    The function X509_verify_cert checks the value of |ctx->chain| at the
    beginning, and if it is NULL then it initialises it, along with the value
    of ctx->untrusted. The normal way to use X509_verify_cert() is to first
    call X509_STORE_CTX_init(); then set up various parameters etc; then call
    X509_verify_cert(); then check the results; and finally call
    X509_STORE_CTX_cleanup(). The initial call to X509_STORE_CTX_init() sets
    |ctx->chain| to NULL. The only place in the OpenSSL codebase  where
    |ctx->chain| is set to anything other than a non NULL value is in
    X509_verify_cert itself. Therefore the only ways that |ctx->chain| could be
    non NULL on entry to X509_verify_cert is if one of the following occurs:
    1) An application calls X509_verify_cert() twice without re-initialising
    in between.
    2) An application reaches inside the X509_STORE_CTX structure and changes
    the value of |ctx->chain| directly.
    
    With regards to the second of these, we should discount this - it should
    not be supported to allow this.
    
    With regards to the first of these, the documentation is not exactly
    crystal clear, but the implication is that you must call
    X509_STORE_CTX_init() before each call to X509_verify_cert(). If you fail
    to do this then, at best, the results would be undefined.
    
    Calling X509_verify_cert() with |ctx->chain| set to a non NULL value is
    likely to have unexpected results, and could be dangerous. This commit
    changes the behaviour of X509_verify_cert() so that it causes an error if
    |ctx->chain| is anything other than NULL (because this indicates that we
    have not been initialised properly). It also clarifies the associated
    documentation. This is a follow up commit to CVE-2015-1793.

    Fix alternate chains certificate forgery issue
    
    During certificate verfification, OpenSSL will attempt to find an
    alternative certificate chain if the first attempt to build such a chain
    fails. An error in the implementation of this logic can mean that an
    attacker could cause certain checks on untrusted certificates to be
    bypassed, such as the CA flag, enabling them to use a valid leaf
    certificate to act as a CA and "issue" an invalid certificate.
    
    This occurs where at least one cert is added to the first chain from the
    trust store, but that chain still ends up being untrusted. In that case
    ctx->last_untrusted is decremented in error.
    
    Patch provided by the BoringSSL project.

    Fix ABI break with HMAC
    
    Recent HMAC changes broke ABI compatibility due to a new field in HMAC_CTX.
    This backs that change out, and does it a different way.

    Obviously this would fail if packets get re-ordered mid-flight.

    Fix DTLS session resumption
    
    The session object on the client side is initially created during
    construction of the ClientHello. If the client is DTLS1.2 capable then it
    will store 1.2 as the version for the session. However if the server is only
    DTLS1.0 capable then when the ServerHello comes back the client switches to
    using DTLS1.0 from then on. However the session version does not get
    updated. Therefore when the client attempts to resume that session the
    server throws an alert because of an incorrect protocol version.

    Fix race condition in NewSessionTicket
    
    If a NewSessionTicket is received by a multi-threaded client when
    attempting to reuse a previous ticket then a race condition can occur
    potentially leading to a double free of the ticket data.
    
    CVE-2015-1791
    
    This also fixes RT#3808 where a session ID is changed for a session already
    in the client session cache. Since the session ID is the key to the cache
    this breaks the cache access.
    
    Parts of this patch were inspired by this Akamai change:

    Check the message type requested is the type received in DTLS
    
    dtls1_get_message has an |mt| variable which is the type of the message that
    is being requested. If it is negative then any message type is allowed.
    However the value of |mt| is not checked in one of the main code paths, so a
    peer can send a message of a completely different type and it will be
    processed as if it was the message type that we were expecting. This has
    very little practical consequences because the current behaviour will still
    fail when the format of the message isn't as expected.

    Fix the update target and remove duplicate file updates
    
    We had updates of certain header files in both Makefile.org and the
    Makefile in the directory the header file lived in.  This is error
    prone and also sometimes generates slightly different results (usually
    just a comment that differs) depending on which way the update was
    done.
    
    This removes the file update targets from the top level Makefile, adds
    an update: target in all Makefiles and has it depend on the depend: or
    local_depend: targets, whichever is appropriate, so we don't get a
    double run through the whole file tree.

    Fix typo setting up certificate masks
    
    The certificate masks are used to select which ciphersuite we are going to
    use. The variables |emask_k| and |emask_a| relate to export grade key
    exchange and authentication respecitively. The variables |mask_k| and
    |mask_a| are the equivalent versions for non-export grade. This fixes an
    instance where the two usages of export/non-export were mixed up. In
    practice it makes little difference since it still works!

    Remove support for the two export grade static DH ciphersuites. These two

    since they were introduced. It seems strange in any case to be adding new

    given.  This will make it easier to backport fixes to release
    branches, where master assumes those lower-level functions are "safe"
    
    This commit addresses those tickets: 3798 3799 3801.

    Call of memcmp with null pointers in obj_cmp()
    
    The function obj_cmp() (file crypto/objects/obj_dat.c) can in some
    situations call memcmp() with a null pointer and a zero length.
    
    This is invalid behaviour. When compiling openssl with undefined
    behaviour sanitizer (add -fsanitize=undefined to compile flags) this
    can be seen. One example that triggers this behaviour is the pkcs7
    command (but there are others, e.g. I've seen it with the timestamp
    function):
    apps/openssl pkcs7 -in test/testp7.pem
    
    What happens is that obj_cmp takes objects of the type ASN1_OBJECT and
    passes their ->data pointer to memcmp. Zero-sized ASN1_OBJECT
    structures can have a null pointer as data.

    Don't allow a CCS when expecting a CertificateVerify
    
    Currently we set change_cipher_spec_ok to 1 before calling
    ssl3_get_cert_verify(). This is because this message is optional and if it
    is not sent then the next thing we would expect to get is the CCS. However,
    although it is optional, we do actually know whether we should be receiving
    one in advance. If we have received a client cert then we should expect
    a CertificateVerify message. By the time we get to this point we will
    already have bombed out if we didn't get a Certificate when we should have
    done, so it is safe just to check whether |peer| is NULL or not. If it is
    we won't get a CertificateVerify, otherwise we will. Therefore we should
    change the logic so that we only attempt to get the CertificateVerify if
    we are expecting one, and not allow a CCS in this scenario.
    
    Whilst this is good practice for TLS it is even more important for DTLS.
    In DTLS messages can be lost. Therefore we may be in a situation where a
    CertificateVerify message does not arrive even though one was sent. In that
    case the next message the server will receive will be the CCS. This could
    also happen if messages get re-ordered in-flight. In DTLS if
    |change_cipher_spec_ok| is not set and a CCS is received it is ignored.
    However if |change_cipher_spec_ok| *is* set then a CCS arrival will
    immediately move the server into the next epoch. Any messages arriving for
    the previous epoch will be ignored. This means that, in this scenario, the
    handshake can never complete. The client will attempt to retransmit
    missing messages, but the server will ignore them because they are the wrong
    epoch. The server meanwhile will still be waiting for the CertificateVerify
    which is never going to arrive.

    Fix buffer overrun in RSA signing
    
    The problem occurs in EVP_PKEY_sign() when using RSA with X931 padding.
    It is only triggered if the RSA key size is smaller than the digest length.
    So with SHA512 you can trigger the overflow with anything less than an RSA
    512 bit key. I managed to trigger a 62 byte overflow when using a 16 bit RSA
    key. This wasn't sufficient to cause a crash, although your mileage may
    vary.
    
    In practice RSA keys of this length are never used and X931 padding is very
    rare. Even if someone did use an excessively short RSA key, the chances of
    them combining that with a longer digest and X931 padding is very
    small. For these reasons I do not believe there is a security implication to
    this. Thanks to Kevin Wojtysiak (Int3 Solutions) and Paramjot Oberoi (Int3
    Solutions) for reporting this issue.

    The static function dynamically allocates an output buffer if the output

    Repair EAP-FAST session resumption
    
    EAP-FAST session resumption relies on handshake message lookahead
    to determine server intentions. Commits
    980bc1ec6114f5511b20c2e6ca741e61a39b99d6
    and
    7b3ba508af5c86afe43e28174aa3c53a0a24f4d9
    removed the lookahead so broke session resumption.
    
    This change partially reverts the commits and brings the lookahead back
    in reduced capacity for TLS + EAP-FAST only. Since EAP-FAST does not
    support regular session tickets, the lookahead now only checks for a
    Finished message.
    
    Regular handshakes are unaffected by this change.

    Fix ssl_get_prev_session overrun
    
    If OpenSSL is configured with no-tlsext then ssl_get_prev_session can read
    past the end of the ClientHello message if the session_id length in the
    ClientHello is invalid. This should not cause any security issues since the
    underlying buffer is 16k in size. It should never be possible to overrun by
    that many bytes.

    too careful.

    Have mkerr.pl treat already existing multiline string defs properly
    
    Since source reformat, we ended up with some error reason string
    definitions that spanned two lines.  That in itself is fine, but we
    sometimes edited them to provide better strings than what could be
    automatically determined from the reason macro, for example:
    
        {ERR_REASON(SSL_R_NO_GOST_CERTIFICATE_SENT_BY_PEER),
         "Peer haven't sent GOST certificate, required for selected ciphersuite"},
    
    However, mkerr.pl didn't treat those two-line definitions right, and
    they ended up being retranslated to whatever the macro name would
    indicate, for example:
    
        {ERR_REASON(SSL_R_NO_GOST_CERTIFICATE_SENT_BY_PEER),
         "No gost certificate sent by peer"},
    
    Clearly not what we wanted.  This change fixes this problem.

    Harden SSLv2-supporting servers against Bleichenbacher's attack.
    
    There is no indication that the timing differences are exploitable in
    OpenSSL, and indeed there is some indication (Usenix '14) that they
    are too small to be exploitable. Nevertheless, be careful and apply
    the same countermeasures as in s3_srvr.c
    
    Thanks to Nimrod Aviram, Sebastian Schinzel and Yuval Shavitt for
    reporting this issue.

    aes/asm/aesv8-armx.pl: optimize for Cortex-A5x.
    
    ARM has optimized Cortex-A5x pipeline to favour pairs of complementary
    AES instructions. While modified code improves performance of post-r0p0
    Cortex-A53 performance by >40% (for CBC decrypt and CTR), it hurts
    original r0p0. We favour later revisions, because one can't prevent
    future from coming. Improvement on post-r0p0 Cortex-A57 exceeds 50%,
    while new code is not slower on r0p0, or Apple A7 for that matter.
    
    [Update even SHA results for latest Cortex-A53.]

    Add ticket length before buffering DTLS message
    
    In ssl3_send_new_session_ticket the message to be sent is constructed. We
    skip adding the length of the session ticket initially, then call
    ssl_set_handshake_header, and finally go back and add in the length of the
    ticket. Unfortunately, in DTLS, ssl_set_handshake_header also has the side
    effect of buffering the message for subsequent retransmission if required.
    By adding the ticket length after the call to ssl_set_handshake_header the
    message that is buffered is incomplete, causing an invalid message to be
    sent on retransmission.

    Ensure last_write_sequence is saved in DTLS1.2
    
    In DTLS, immediately prior to epoch change, the write_sequence is supposed
    to be stored in s->d1->last_write_sequence. The write_sequence is then reset
    back to 00000000. In the event of retransmits of records from the previous
    epoch, the last_write_sequence is restored. This commit fixes a bug in
    DTLS1.2 where the write_sequence was being reset before last_write_sequence
    was saved, and therefore retransmits are sent with incorrect sequence
    numbers.

    Fix Seg fault in DTLSv1_listen
    
    The DTLSv1_listen function is intended to be stateless and processes
    the initial ClientHello from many peers. It is common for user code to
    loop over the call to DTLSv1_listen until a valid ClientHello is received
    with an associated cookie. A defect in the implementation of DTLSv1_listen
    means that state is preserved in the SSL object from one invokation to the
    next that can lead to a segmentation fault. Erorrs processing the initial
    ClientHello can trigger this scenario. An example of such an error could
    be that a DTLS1.0 only client is attempting to connect to a DTLS1.2 only
    server.

    Multiblock corrupted pointer fix
    
    OpenSSL 1.0.2 introduced the "multiblock" performance improvement. This
    feature only applies on 64 bit x86 architecture platforms that support AES
    NI instructions. A defect in the implementation of "multiblock" can cause
    OpenSSL's internal write buffer to become incorrectly set to NULL when
    using non-blocking IO. Typically, when the user application is using a
    socket BIO for writing, this will only result in a failed connection.
    However if some other BIO is used then it is likely that a segmentation
    fault will be triggered, thus enabling a potential DoS attack.

    Fix undefined behaviour in shifts.
    
    Td4 and Te4 are arrays of u8. A u8 << int promotes the u8 to an int first then shifts.
    If the mathematical result of a shift (as modelled by lhs * 2^{rhs}) is not representable
    in an integer, behaviour is undefined. In other words, you can't shift into the sign bit
    of a signed integer. Fix this by casting to u32 whenever we're shifting left by 24.
    
    (For consistency, cast other shifts, too.)

    ASN1_primitive_new NULL param handling
    
    ASN1_primitive_new takes an ASN1_ITEM * param |it|. There are a couple
    of conditional code paths that check whether |it| is NULL or not - but
    later |it| is deref'd unconditionally. If |it| was ever really NULL then
    this would seg fault. In practice ASN1_primitive_new is marked as an
    internal function in the public header file. The only places it is ever
    used internally always pass a non NULL parameter for |it|. Therefore, change
    the code to sanity check that |it| is not NULL, and remove the conditional
    checking.

    Prevent handshake with unseeded PRNG
    
    Fix security issue where under certain conditions a client can complete a
    handshake with an unseeded PRNG. The conditions are:
    - Client is on a platform where the PRNG has not been seeded, and the
    user has not seeded manually
    - A protocol specific client method version has been used (i.e. not
    SSL_client_methodv23)
    - A ciphersuite is used that does not require additional random data
    from the PRNG beyond the initial ClientHello client random
    (e.g. PSK-RC4-SHA)
    
    If the handshake succeeds then the client random that has been used will
    have been generated from a PRNG with insufficient entropy and therefore
    the output may be predictable.
    
    For example using the following command with an unseeded openssl will
    succeed on an unpatched platform:
    
    openssl s_client -psk 1a2b3c4d -tls1_2 -cipher PSK-RC4-SHA

    1.x and Cisco's pre-standard version of DTLS (DTLS1_BAD_VER).

    Restore -DTERMIO/-DTERMIOS on Windows platforms.
    
    The previous defaulting to TERMIOS took away -DTERMIOS / -DTERMIO a
    bit too enthusiastically.  Windows/DOSish platforms of all sorts get
    identified as OPENSSL_SYS_MSDOS, and they get a different treatment
    altogether UNLESS -DTERMIO or -DTERMIOS is explicitely given with the
    configuration.  The answer is to restore those macro definitions for
    the affected configuration targets.

    Assume TERMIOS is default, remove TERMIO on all Linux.
    
    The rationale for this move is that TERMIOS is default, supported by
    POSIX-1.2001, and most definitely on Linux.  For a few other systems,
    TERMIO may still be the termnial interface of preference, so we keep
    -DTERMIO on those in Configure.
    
    crypto/ui/ui_openssl.c is simplified in this regard, and will define
    TERMIOS for all systems except a select few exceptions.

    indent has problems with comments that are on the right hand side of a line.
    Sometimes it fails to format them very well, and sometimes it corrupts them!
    This commit moves some particularly problematic ones.

    A memory leak can occur in dtls1_buffer_record if either of the calls to
    ssl3_setup_buffers or pqueue_insert fail. The former will fail if there is a
    malloc failure, whilst the latter will fail if attempting to add a duplicate
    record to the queue. This should never happen because duplicate records should
    be detected and dropped before any attempt to add them to the queue.
    Unfortunately records that arrive that are for the next epoch are not being
    recorded correctly, and therefore replays are not being detected.
    Additionally, these "should not happen" failures that can occur in
    dtls1_buffer_record are not being treated as fatal and therefore an attacker
    could exploit this by sending repeated replay records for the next epoch,
    eventually causing a DoS through memory exhaustion.
    
    Thanks to Chris Mueller for reporting this issue and providing initial
    analysis and a patch. Further analysis and the final patch was performed by
    Matt Caswell from the OpenSSL development team.

    If we've used a client certificate to generate the premaster secret

    Only allow ephemeral RSA keys in export ciphersuites.
    
    OpenSSL clients would tolerate temporary RSA keys in non-export
    ciphersuites. It also had an option SSL_OP_EPHEMERAL_RSA which
    enabled this server side. Remove both options as they are a
    protocol violation.

    Fix various certificate fingerprint issues.
    
    By using non-DER or invalid encodings outside the signed portion of a
    certificate the fingerprint can be changed without breaking the signature.
    Although no details of the signed portion of the certificate can be changed
    this can cause problems with some applications: e.g. those using the
    certificate fingerprint for blacklists.
    
    1. Reject signatures with non zero unused bits.
    
    If the BIT STRING containing the signature has non zero unused bits reject
    the signature. All current signature algorithms require zero unused bits.
    
    2. Check certificate algorithm consistency.
    
    Check the AlgorithmIdentifier inside TBS matches the one in the
    certificate signature. NB: this will result in signature failure
    errors for some broken certificates.
    
    3. Check DSA/ECDSA signatures use DER.
    
    Reencode DSA/ECDSA signatures and compare with the original received
    signature. Return an error if there is a mismatch.
    
    This will reject various cases including garbage after signature
    (thanks to Antti Karjalainen and Tuomo Untinen from the Codenomicon CROSS
    program for discovering this case) and use of BER or invalid ASN.1 INTEGERs
    (negative or with leading zeroes).

    Don't set client_version to the ServerHello version.
    
    The client_version needs to be preserved for the RSA key exchange.
    
    This change also means that renegotiation will, like TLS, repeat the old
    client_version rather than advertise only the final version. (Either way,
    version change on renego is not allowed.) This is necessary in TLS to work
    around an SChannel bug, but it's not strictly necessary in DTLS.

    There are a number of instances throughout the code where the constant 28 is
    used with no explanation. Some of this was introduced as part of RT#1929. The
    value 28 is the length of the IP header (20 bytes) plus the UDP header (8
    bytes). However use of this constant is incorrect because there may be
    instances where a different value is needed, e.g. an IPv4 header is 20 bytes
    but an IPv6 header is 40. Similarly you may not be using UDP (e.g. SCTP).
    This commit introduces a new BIO_CTRL that provides the value to be used for
    this mtu "overhead". It will be used by subsequent commits.

    The first call to query the mtu in dtls1_do_write correctly checks that the
    mtu that we have received is not less than the minimum. If its less it uses the
    minimum instead. The second call to query the mtu does not do that, but
    instead uses whatever comes back. We have seen an instance in RT#3592 where we
    have got an unreasonably small mtu come back. This commit makes both query
    checks consistent.

    Ensure SSL3_FLAGS_CCS_OK (or d1->change_cipher_spec_ok for DTLS) is reset
    once the ChangeCipherSpec message is received. Previously, the server would
    set the flag once at SSL3_ST_SR_CERT_VRFY and again at SSL3_ST_SR_FINISHED.
    This would allow a second CCS to arrive and would corrupt the server state.
    
    (Because the first CCS would latch the correct keys and subsequent CCS
    messages would have to be encrypted, a MitM attacker cannot exploit this,
    though.)

    Parse custom extensions after SNI.
    
    Since SNI will typically switch the SSL_CTX structure to the one
    corresponding to the appopriate server we need to parse custom

    Keep old method in case of an unsupported protocol
    
    When we're configured with no-ssl3 and we receive an SSL v3 Client Hello, we set
    the method to NULL.  We didn't used to do that, and it breaks things.  This is a
    regression introduced in 62f45cc27d07187b59551e4fad3db4e52ea73f2c.  Keep the old
    method since the code is not able to deal with a NULL method at this time.

    psk_client_callback, 128-byte id bug.
    
    Fix a bug in handling of 128 byte long PSK identity in
    psk_client_callback.
    
    OpenSSL supports PSK identities of up to (and including) 128 bytes in
    length. PSK identity is obtained via the psk_client_callback,
    implementors of which are expected to provide a NULL-terminated
    identity. However, the callback is invoked with only 128 bytes of
    storage thus making it impossible to return a 128 byte long identity and
    the required additional NULL byte.
    
    This CL fixes the issue by passing in a 129 byte long buffer into the
    psk_client_callback. As a safety precaution, this CL also zeroes out the
    buffer before passing it into the callback, uses strnlen for obtaining
    the length of the identity returned by the callback, and aborts the
    handshake if the identity (without the NULL terminator) is longer than
    128 bytes.
    
    (Original patch amended to achieve strnlen in a different way.)

    Additionally, in |dtls1_process_out_of_seq_message|, we know that

    Fix return code for truncated DTLS fragment.
    
    Previously, a truncated DTLS fragment in
    |dtls1_process_out_of_seq_message| would cause *ok to be cleared, but
    the return value would still be the number of bytes read. This would
    cause |dtls1_get_message| not to consider it an error and it would
    continue processing as normal until the calling function noticed that
    *ok was zero.
    
    I can't see an exploit here because |dtls1_get_message| uses
    |s->init_num| as the length, which will always be zero from what I can
    see.

    Fix memory leak from zero-length DTLS fragments.
    
    The |pqueue_insert| function can fail if one attempts to insert a
    duplicate sequence number. When handling a fragment of an out of
    sequence message, |dtls1_process_out_of_seq_message| would not call
    |dtls1_reassemble_fragment| if the fragment's length was zero. It would
    then allocate a fresh fragment and attempt to insert it, but ignore the
    return value, leaking the fragment.
    
    This allows an attacker to exhaust the memory of a DTLS peer.

    Fix DTLS handshake message size checks.
    
    In |dtls1_reassemble_fragment|, the value of
    |msg_hdr->frag_off+frag_len| was being checked against the maximum
    handshake message size, but then |msg_len| bytes were allocated for the
    fragment buffer. This means that so long as the fragment was within the
    allowed size, the pending handshake message could consume 16MB + 2MB
    (for the reassembly bitmap). Approx 10 outstanding handshake messages
    are allowed, meaning that an attacker could consume ~180MB per DTLS
    connection.
    
    In the non-fragmented path (in |dtls1_process_out_of_seq_message|), no
    check was applied.
    
    Fixes CVE-2014-3506

    Clarified that the signature's buffer size, `s`, is not used as an

    Under the old docs, the only thing stated was "at most
    EVP_PKEY_size(pkey) bytes will be written". It was kind of misleading
    since it appears EVP_PKEY_size(pkey) WILL be written regardless of the
    signature's buffer size.

    Adjust VMS build to Unix build.  Most of all, make it so the disabled
    algorithms MD2 and RC5 don't get built.

    they have no support at all.

    Create test/testutil.h for unit test helper macros
    
    Defines SETUP_TEST_FIXTURE and EXECUTE_TEST, and updates ssl/heartbeat_test.c
    using these macros. SETUP_TEST_FIXTURE makes use of the new TEST_CASE_NAME
    macro, defined to use __func__ or __FUNCTION__ on platforms that support those
    symbols, or to use the file name and line number otherwise. This should fix
    several reported build problems related to lack of C99 support.

Author: Dr. Stephen Henson <steve@openssl.org>
Date:   Tue May 13 18:48:31 2014 +0100

    Fix for CVE-2014-0195
    
    A buffer overrun attack can be triggered by sending invalid DTLS fragments
    to an OpenSSL DTLS client or server. This is potentially exploitable to
    run arbitrary code on a vulnerable client or server.
    
    Fixed by adding consistency check for DTLS fragments.
    
    Thanks to Jüri Aedla for reporting this issue.

    Fix for CVE-2014-0224
    
    Only accept change cipher spec when it is expected instead of at any
    time. This prevents premature setting of session keys before the master
    secret is determined which an attacker could use as a MITM attack.
    
    Thanks to KIKUCHI Masashi (Lepidum Co. Ltd.) for reporting this issue
    and providing the initial fix this patch is based on.

    dso: eliminate VMS code on non-VMS systems
    
    Even though the meat of dso_vms.c is compiled out on non-VMS builds,
    the (pre-)compiler still traverses some of the macro handling. This
    trips up at least one non-VMS build configuration, so this commit
    makes the skip-VMS case more robust.

    bignum: allow concurrent BN_MONT_CTX_set_locked()
    
    The lazy-initialisation of BN_MONT_CTX was serialising all threads, as
    noted by Daniel Sands and co at Sandia. This was to handle the case that
    2 or more threads race to lazy-init the same context, but stunted all
    scalability in the case where 2 or more threads are doing unrelated
    things! We favour the latter case by punishing the former. The init work
    gets done by each thread that finds the context to be uninitialised, and
    we then lock the "set" logic after that work is done - the winning
    thread's work gets used, the losing threads throw away what they've done.

    Treat a zero length passed to ssleay_rand_add a no op: the existing logic

    zero bytes of entropy.

    SPARC T4 assembly pack: treat zero input length in CBC.
    
    The problem is that OpenSSH calls EVP_Cipher, which is not as
    protective as EVP_CipherUpdate. Formally speaking we ought to
    do more checks in *_cipher methods, including rejecting
    lengths not divisible by block size (unless ciphertext stealing
    is in place). But for now I implement check for zero length in
    low-level based on precedent.

    Add function to free compression methods.
    
    Although the memory allocated by compression methods is fixed and
    cannot grow over time it can cause warnings in some leak checking
    tools. The function SSL_COMP_free_compression_methods() will free
    and zero the list of supported compression methods. This should
    *only* be called in a single threaded context when an application
    is shutting down to avoid interfering with existing contexts
    attempting to look up compression methods.

    Avoid Windows 8 Getversion deprecated errors.
    
    Windows 8 SDKs complain that GetVersion() is deprecated.
    
    We only use GetVersion like this:
    
    	(GetVersion() < 0x80000000)
    
    which checks if the Windows version is NT based. Use a macro check_winnt()
    which uses GetVersion() on older SDK versions and true otherwise.

    Use defaults bits in req when not given
    
    If you use "-newkey rsa" it's supposed to read the default number of bits from the
    config file.  However the value isn't used to generate the key, but it does
    print it's generating such a key.  The set_keygen_ctx() doesn't call
    EVP_PKEY_CTX_set_rsa_keygen_bits() and you end up with the default set in
    pkey_rsa_init() (1024).  Afterwards the number of bits gets read from the config
    file, but nothing is done with that anymore.
    
    We now read the config first and use the value from the config file when no size
    is given.

    Document pkcs12 -password behavior
    
    apps/pkcs12.c accepts -password as an argument.  The document author
    almost certainly meant to write "-password, -passin".
    
    However, that is not correct, either.  Actually the code treats
    -password as equivalent to -passin, EXCEPT when -export is also
    specified, in which case -password as equivalent to -passout.

    Updating DTCP authorization type to expected value

commit fc213217e8db600093bb7976a11e738c8b4bb948
Author: Scott Deboy <sdeboy@secondstryke.com>
Date:   Thu Sep 12 12:03:40 2013 -0700

    Update custom TLS extension and supplemental data 'generate' callbacks to support sending an alert.
    
    If multiple TLS extensions are expected but not received, the TLS extension and supplemental data 'generate' callbacks are the only chance for the receive-side to trigger a specific TLS alert during the handshake.
    
    Removed logic which no-op'd TLS extension generate callbacks (as the generate callbacks need to always be called in order to trigger alerts), and updated the serverinfo-specific custom TLS extension callbacks to track which custom TLS extensions were received by the client, where no-ops for 'generate' callbacks are appropriate.

    Add callbacks supporting generation and retrieval of supplemental data entries, facilitating RFC 5878 (TLS auth extensions)
    Removed prior audit proof logic - audit proof support was implemented using the generic TLS extension API
    Tests exercising the new supplemental data registration and callback api can be found in ssltest.c.
    Implemented changes to s_server and s_client to exercise supplemental data callbacks via the -auth argument, as well as additional flags to exercise supplemental data being sent only during renegotiation.

    Return per-certificate chain if extra chain is NULL.
    
    If an application calls the macro SSL_CTX_get_extra_chain_certs
    return either the old "shared" extra certificates or those associated
    with the current certificate.
    
    This means applications which call SSL_CTX_use_certificate_chain_file
    and retrieve the additional chain using SSL_CTX_get_extra_chain_certs
    will still work. An application which only wants to check the shared
    extra certificates can call the new macro
    SSL_CTX_get_extra_chain_certs_only

    Add volatile qualifications to two blocks of inline asm to stop GCC from
    eliminating them as dead code.
    
    Both volatile and "memory" are used because of some concern that the compiler
    may still cache values across the asm block without it, and because this was
    such a painful debugging session that I wanted to ensure that it's never
    repeated.

    The flag SSL_OP_MSIE_SSLV2_RSA_PADDING hasn't done anything since OpenSSL
    0.9.7h but deleting it will break source compatibility with any software
    that references it. Restore it but #define to zero.

    SHA512_Transform was initially added rather as tribute to tradition

    and it turned to be problematic on platforms that don't tolerate
    misasligned references to memory and lack assembly subroutine.

    Avoid multiple locks in FIPS mode.
    
    PR: 3176.
    
    In FIPS mode ssleay_rand_bytes is only used for PRNG seeding and is
    performed in either a single threaded context (when the PRNG is first
    initialised) or under a lock (reseeding). To avoid multiple locks disable
    use of CRYPTO_LOCK_RAND in FIPS mode in ssleay_rand_bytes.

    Additional "chain_cert" functions.
    
    PR#3169
    
    This patch, which currently applies successfully against master and
    1_0_2, adds the following functions:
    
    SSL_[CTX_]select_current_cert() - set the current certificate without
    disturbing the existing structure.
    
    SSL_[CTX_]get0_chain_certs() - get the current certificate's chain.
    
    SSL_[CTX_]clear_chain_certs() - clear the current certificate's chain.
    
    The patch also adds these functions to, and fixes some existing errors
    in, SSL_CTX_add1_chain_cert.pod.

    DTLS/SCTP struct authchunks Bug
    
    PR: 2809
    
    DTLS/SCTP requires DATA and FORWARD-TSN chunks to be protected with
    SCTP-AUTH.  It is checked if this has been activated successfully for
    the local and remote peer. Due to a bug, however, the
    gauth_number_of_chunks field of the authchunks struct is missing on
    FreeBSD, and was therefore not considered in the OpenSSL implementation.
    This patch sets the corresponding pointer for the check correctly
    whether or not this bug is present.

    DTLS/SCTP Finished Auth Bug
    
    PR: 2808
    
    With DTLS/SCTP the SCTP extension SCTP-AUTH is used to protect DATA and
    FORWARD-TSN chunks. The key for this extension is derived from the
    master secret and changed with the next ChangeCipherSpec, whenever a new
    key has been negotiated. The following Finished then already uses the
    new key.  Unfortunately, the ChangeCipherSpec and Finished are part of
    the same flight as the ClientKeyExchange, which is necessary for the
    computation of the new secret. Hence, these messages are sent
    immediately following each other, leaving the server very little time to
    compute the new secret and pass it to SCTP before the finished arrives.
    So the Finished is likely to be discarded by SCTP and a retransmission
    becomes necessary. To prevent this issue, the Finished of the client is
    still sent with the old key.

    Fix another gmt_unix_time case in server_random

commit d757097bbca11f677dd8204b6364db3764cfe17c

    Do not include a timestamp in the Client/ServerHello Random field.
    
    Instead, send random bytes, unless SSL_SEND_{CLIENT,SERVER}RANDOM_MODE
    is set.
    
    This is a forward-port of commits:
      4af793036f6ef4f0a1078e5d7155426a98d50e37

      2583270191a8b27eed303c03ece1da97b9b69fd3
    
    While the gmt_unix_time record was added in an ostensible attempt to
    mitigate the dangers of a bad RNG, its presence leaks the host's view
    of the current time in the clear.  This minor leak can help
    fingerprint TLS instances across networks and protocols... and what's
    worse, it's doubtful thet the gmt_unix_time record does any good at
    all for its intended purpose, since:
    
        * It's quite possible to open two TLS connections in one second.
    
        * If the PRNG output is prone to repeat itself, ephemeral
          handshakes (and who knows what else besides) are broken.

    Removing RSA+MD5 from the default signature algorithm list

    If a broken implementation attempts to use RSA+MD5 anyway the sanity
    checking of signature algorithms will cause a fatal alert.

    Since this is always called from DTLS code it is safe to assume the header

    DTLS revision.
    
    Revise DTLS code. There was a *lot* of code duplication in the
    DTLS code that generates records. This makes it harder to maintain and
    sometimes a TLS update is omitted by accident from the DTLS code.
    
    Specifically almost all of the record generation functions have code like
    this:
    
    some_pointer = buffer + HANDSHAKE_HEADER_LENGTH;
    ... Record creation stuff ...
    set_handshake_header(ssl, SSL_MT_SOMETHING, message_len);
    
    ...
    
    write_handshake_message(ssl);
    
    Where the "Record creation stuff" is identical between SSL/TLS and DTLS or
    in some cases has very minor differences.
    
    By adding a few fields to SSL3_ENC to include the header length, some flags
    and function pointers for handshake header setting and handshake writing the
    code can cope with both cases.

        Fix overly lenient comparisons:
    
        - EC_GROUP_cmp shouldn't consider curves equal just because
          the curve name is the same. (They really *should* be the same
          in this case, but there's an EC_GROUP_set_curve_name API,
          which could be misused.)
    
        - EC_POINT_cmp shouldn't return 0 for ERR_R_SHOULD_NOT_HAVE_BEEN_CALLED
          or EC_R_INCOMPATIBLE_OBJECTS errors because in a cmp API, 0 indicates
          equality (not an error).

          the curve name is the same. (They really *should* be the same
          in this case, but there's an EC_GROUP_set_curve_name API,
          which could be misused.)
    
        - EC_POINT_cmp shouldn't return 0 for ERR_R_SHOULD_NOT_HAVE_BEEN_CALLED
          or EC_R_INCOMPATIBLE_OBJECTS errors because in a cmp API, 0 indicates
          equality (not an error).

    DTLS message_sequence number wrong in rehandshake ServerHello
    
    This fix ensures that
    * A HelloRequest is retransmitted if not responded by a ClientHello
    * The HelloRequest "consumes" the sequence number 0. The subsequent
    ServerHello uses the sequence number 1.
    * The client also expects the sequence number of the ServerHello to
    be 1 if a HelloRequest was received earlier.
    This patch fixes the RFC violation.

    crypto/modes/modes_lcl.h: let STRICT_ALIGNMENT be on ARMv7.
    
    While ARMv7 in general is capable of unaligned access, not all instructions
    actually are. And trouble is that compiler doesn't seem to differentiate
    those capable and incapable of unaligned access. Side effect is that kernel
    goes into endless loop retrying same instruction triggering unaligned trap.
    Problem was observed in xts128.c and ccm128.c modules. It's possible to
    resolve it by using (volatile u32*) casts, but letting STRICT_ALIGNMENT
    be feels more appropriate.

    Fix POD errors to stop make install_docs dying with pod2man 2.5.0+
    
    podlators 2.5.0 has switched to dying on POD syntax errors. This means
    that a bunch of long-standing erroneous POD in the openssl documentation
    now leads to fatal errors from pod2man, halting installation.
    
    Unfortunately POD constraints mean that you have to sort numeric lists
    in ascending order if they start with 1: you cannot do 1, 0, 2 even if
    you want 1 to appear first. I've reshuffled such (alas, I wish there
    were a better way but I don't know of one).

    Don't crash when processing a zero-length, TLS >= 1.1 record.
    
    The previous CBC patch was bugged in that there was a path through enc()
    in s3_pkt.c/d1_pkt.c which didn't set orig_len. orig_len would be left

    Make CBC decoding constant time.
    
    This patch makes the decoding of SSLv3 and TLS CBC records constant
    time. Without this, a timing side-channel can be used to build a padding
    oracle and mount Vaudenay's attack.
    
    This patch also disables the stitched AESNI+SHA mode pending a similar
    fix to that code.
    
    In order to be easy to backport, this change is implemented in ssl/,
    rather than as a generic AEAD mode. In the future this should be changed
    around so that HMAC isn't in ssl/, but crypto/ as FIPS expects.

    Add and use a constant-time memcmp.
    
    This change adds CRYPTO_memcmp, which compares two vectors of bytes in
    an amount of time that's independent of their contents. It also changes
    several MAC compares in the code to use this over the standard memcmp,
    which may leak information about the size of a matching prefix.

Date:   Wed Dec 26 15:21:53 2012 +0000

    Add support for certificate stores in CERT structure. This makes it
    possible to have different stores per SSL structure or one store in
    the parent SSL_CTX. Include distint stores for certificate chain
    verification and chain building. New ctrl SSL_CTRL_BUILD_CERT_CHAIN
    to build and store a certificate chain in CERT structure: returing
    an error if the chain cannot be built: this will allow applications
    to test if a chain is correctly configured.
    
    Note: if the CERT based stores are not set then the parent SSL_CTX
    store is used to retain compatibility with existing behaviour.

    Add certificate callback. If set this is called whenever a certificate
    is required by client or server. An application can decide which
    certificate chain to present based on arbitrary criteria: for example
    supported signature algorithms. Add very simple example to s_server.
    This fixes many of the problems and restrictions of the existing client
    certificate callback: for example you can now clear existing certificates
    and specify the whole chain.

    Add new "valid_flags" field to CERT_PKEY structure which determines what
    the certificate can be used for (if anything). Set valid_flags field
    in new tls1_check_chain function. Simplify ssl_set_cert_masks which used
    to have similar checks in it.
    
    Add new "cert_flags" field to CERT structure and include a "strict mode".
    This enforces some TLS certificate requirements (such as only permitting
    certificate signature algorithms contained in the supported algorithms
    extension) which some implementations ignore: this option should be used
    with caution as it could cause interoperability issues.

    Don't load GOST ENGINE if it is already loaded.
    
    Multiple copies of the ENGINE will cause problems when it is cleaned up as
    the methods are stored in static structures which will be overwritten and
    freed up more than once.
    
    Set static methods to NULL when the ENGINE is freed so it can be reloaded.

    Experimental multi-implementation support for FIPS capable OpenSSL.
    When in FIPS mode the approved implementations are used as normal,
    when not in FIPS mode the internal unapproved versions are used instead.
    This means that the FIPS capable OpenSSL isn't forced to use the
    (often lower perfomance) FIPS implementations outside FIPS mode.

    Partial workaround for PR#2771.
    
    Some servers hang when presented with a client hello record length exceeding
    255 bytes but will work with longer client hellos if the TLS record version
    in client hello does not exceed TLS v1.0. Unfortunately this doesn't fix all
    cases...

    Additional compatibility fix for MDC2 signature format.
    
    Update RSA EVP_PKEY_METHOD to use the OCTET STRING form of MDC2 signature:
    this will make all versions of MDC2 signature equivalent.

commit 16b7c81d55e528edd5186004ec0691e1461faeab
Author: Dr. Stephen Henson <steve@openssl.org>
Date:   Wed Feb 15 14:00:09 2012 +0000

    An incompatibility has always existed between the format used for RSA
    signatures and MDC2 using EVP or RSA_sign. This has become more apparent
    when the dgst utility in OpenSSL 1.0.0 and later switched to using the
    EVP_DigestSign functions which call RSA_sign.
    
    This means that the signature format OpenSSL 1.0.0 and later used with
    dgst -sign and MDC2 is incompatible with previous versions.
    
    Add detection in RSA_verify so either format works.
    
    Note: MDC2 is disabled by default in OpenSSL and very rarely used in practice.

    Expand OPENSSL_ia32cap_P to 64 bits. It might appear controversial, because
    such operation can be considered as breaking binary compatibility. However!
    OPNESSL_ia32cap_P is accessed by application through pointer returned by
    OPENSSL_ia32cap_loc() and such change of *internal* OPENSSL_ia32cap_P
    declaration is possible specifically on little-endian platforms, such as
    x86[_64] ones in question. In addition, if 32-bit application calls
    OPENSSL_ia32cap_loc(), it clears upper half of capability vector maintaining
    the illusion that it's still 32 bits wide.

    The first of many changes to make OpenSSL 1.0.1 FIPS capable.
    
    Add static build support to openssl utility.
    
    Add new "fips" option to Configure.
    
    Make use of installed fipsld and fips_standalone_sha1
    
    Initialise FIPS error callbacks, locking and DRBG.
    
    Doesn't do anything much yet: no crypto is redirected to the FIPS module.
    
    Doesn't completely build either but the openssl utility can enter FIPS mode:
    which doesn't do anything much either.

    Add server client certificate support for TLS v1.2 . This is more complex
    than client side as we need to keep the handshake record cache frozen when
    it contains all the records need to process the certificate verify message.

Author: Dr. Stephen Henson <steve@openssl.org>
Date:   Wed May 11 12:56:38 2011 +0000

    Initial "opaque SSL" framework. If an application defines OPENSSL_NO_SSL_INTERN
    all ssl related structures are opaque and internals cannot be directly
    accessed. Many applications will need some modification to support this and
    most likely some additional functions added to OpenSSL.
    
    The advantage of this option is that any application supporting it will still
    be binary compatible if SSL structures change.

    For VMS, implement the possibility to choose 64-bit pointers with
    different options:
    "64"		The build system will choose /POINTER_SIZE=64=ARGV if
    		the compiler supports it, otherwise /POINTER_SIZE=64.
    "64="		The build system will force /POINTER_SIZE=64.
    "64=ARGV"	The build system will force /POINTER_SIZE=64=ARGV.

    this branch yet, it should be harmless.

    The fix for PR#1949 unfortunately broke cases where the BIO_CTRL_WPENDING
    ctrl is incorrectly implemented (e.g. some versions of Apache). As a workaround
    call both BIO_CTRL_INFO and BIO_CTRL_WPENDING if it returns zero. This should
    both address the original bug and retain compatibility with the old behaviour.

    SSL_library_init().

Date:   Tue Dec 8 13:15:12 2009 +0000

    Add support for magic cipher suite value (MCSV). Make secure renegotiation
    work in SSLv3: initial handshake has no extensions but includes MCSV, if
    server indicates RI support then renegotiation handshakes include RI.
    
    NB: current MCSV value is bogus for testing only, will be updated when we
    have an official value.
    
    Change mismatch alerts to handshake_failure as required by spec.
    
    Also have some debugging fprintfs so we can clearly see what is going on
    if OPENSSL_RI_DEBUG is set.

Date:   Sat Oct 31 19:21:47 2009 +0000

    Add missing functions to allow access to newer X509_STORE_CTX status
    information. Add more informative message to verify callback to indicate
    when CRL path validation is taking place.

Author: Dr. Stephen Henson <steve@openssl.org>
Date:   Sat Oct 31 13:34:19 2009 +0000

    Add option to allow in-band CRL loading in verify utility. Add function
    load_crls and tidy up load_certs. Remove useless purpose variable from
    verify utility: now done with args_verify.

    Generate stateless session ID just after the ticket is received instead
    of when a session is loaded. This will mean that applications that
    just hold onto SSL_SESSION structures and never call d2i_SSL_SESSION()
    will still work.

    Avoid memory leak and fix error reporting in d2i_SSL_SESSION(). NB: although
    the ticket mentions buffer overruns this isn't a security issue because
    the SSL_SESSION structure is generated internally and it should never be
    possible to supply its contents from an untrusted application (this would
    among other things destroy session cache security).

    Fix compilation with -no-comp by adding some more #ifndef OPENSSL_NO_COMP
    
    Some #include statements were not properly protected. This will go unnoted
    on most systems as openssl/comp.h tends to be installed as a system header
    file by default but may become visible when cross compiling.

    Optimize CAST for size on 64-bit platforms. For reference, CAST_LONG being
    unsigned long must be attributed to 16-bit support. As we don't support
    16-bit platoforms anymore, there is no reason to waste twice required
    space on CAST S-boxes (16KB vs. 8KB) or key schedule.

    This _WIN32-specific patch makes it possible to "wrap" OpenSSL in another
    .DLL, in particular static build. The issue has been discussed in RT#1230
    and later on openssl-dev, and mutually exclusive approaches were suggested.
    This completes compromise solution suggested in RT#1230.

    128-bit block cipher modes consolidation. As consolidated functions
    rely on indirect call to block functions, they are not as fast as
    non-consolidated routines. However, performance loss(*) is within
    measurement error and consolidation advantages are considered to
    outweigh it.
    
    (*) actually one can observe performance *improvement* on e.g.
        CBC benchmarks thanks to optimization, which also becomes
        shared among ciphers.

     * This release balances code size and performance. In particular key
     * schedule setup is fully unrolled, because doing so *significantly*
     * reduces amount of instructions per setup round and code increase is
     * justifiable. In block functions on the other hand only inner loops
     * are unrolled, as full unroll gives only nominal performance boost,
     * while code size grows 4 or 7 times. Also, unlike previous versions
     * this one "encourages" compiler to keep intermediate variables in
     * registers, which should give better "all round" results, in other
     * words reasonable performance even with not so modern compilers.

    When the underlying BIO_write() fails to send a datagram, we leave the
    offending record queued as 'pending'. The DTLS code doesn't expect this,
    and we end up hitting an OPENSSL_assert() in do_dtls1_write().
    
    The simple fix is just _not_ to leave it queued. In DTLS, dropping
    packets is perfectly acceptable -- and even preferable. If we wanted a
    service with retries and guaranteed delivery, we'd be using TCP.

    Remove the dual-callback scheme for numeric and pointer thread IDs,
    deprecate the original (numeric-only) scheme, and replace with the
    CRYPTO_THREADID object. This hides the platform-specifics and should reduce
    the possibility for programming errors (where failing to explicitly check
    both thread ID forms could create subtle, platform-specific bugs).
    
    Thanks to Bodo, for invaluable review and feedback.

commit f7ccba3edf9f1f02d7bd3b019d7bc96f25a95718
Author: Geoff Thorpe <geoff@openssl.org>
Date:   Fri Mar 28 02:49:43 2008 +0000

    There was a need to support thread ID types that couldn't be reliably cast
    to 'unsigned long' (ie. odd platforms/compilers), so a pointer-typed
    version was added but it required portable code to check *both* modes to
    determine equality. This commit maintains the availability of both thread
    ID types, but deprecates the type-specific accessor APIs that invoke the
    callbacks - instead a single type-independent API is used.  This simplifies
    software that calls into this interface, and should also make it less
    error-prone - as forgetting to call and compare *both* thread ID accessors
    could have led to hard-to-debug/infrequent bugs (that might only affect
    certain platforms or thread implementations). As the CHANGES note says,
    there were corresponding deprecations and replacements in the
    thread-related functions for BN_BLINDING and ERR too.

    compressedData content type) use that instead.

    Change submitted by Doug Kaufman.  He writes:
    
      I just compiled the 9.9-dev version from the 12022007 tarball under
      DJGPP. There were only 2 changes needed, one for b_sock.c, since
      DJGPP with WATT32 doesn't define socklen_t and one for testtsa to
      handle DOS style path separators. I also noted what seems to be a
      typographical error in ts.pod. The test suite passes. The patch is
      attached.
    
      Since I am in the US, I have sent notifications to the Bureau of
      Industry and Security and to the NSA.

commit 0e1dba934fa53e9736e9156b9e25bd1010290149
Author: Dr. Stephen Henson <steve@openssl.org>
Date:   Fri Oct 26 12:06:36 2007 +0000

    1. Changes for s_client.c to make it return non-zero exit code in case
    of handshake failure
    
    2. Changes to x509_certificate_type function (crypto/x509/x509type.c) to
    make it recognize GOST certificates as EVP_PKT_SIGN|EVP_PKT_EXCH
    (required for s3_srvr to accept GOST client certificates).
    
    3. Changes to EVP
    	- adding of function EVP_PKEY_CTX_get0_peerkey
    	- Make function EVP_PKEY_derive_set_peerkey work for context with
    	  ENCRYPT operation, because we use peerkey field in the context to
    	  pass non-ephemeral secret key to GOST encrypt operation.
    	- added EVP_PKEY_CTRL_SET_IV control command. It is really
    	  GOST-specific, but it is used in SSL code, so it has to go
    	  in some header file, available during libssl compilation
    
    4. Fix to HMAC to avoid call of OPENSSL_cleanse on undefined data
    
    5. Include des.h if KSSL_DEBUG is defined into some libssl files, to
      make debugging output which depends on constants defined there, work
      and other KSSL_DEBUG output fixes
    
    6. Declaration of real GOST ciphersuites, two authentication methods
       SSL_aGOST94 and SSL_aGOST2001 and one key exchange method SSL_kGOST
    
    7. Implementation  of these methods.
    
    8. Support for sending unsolicited serverhello extension if GOST
      ciphersuite is selected. It is require for interoperability with
      CryptoPro CSP 3.0 and 3.6 and controlled by
      SSL_OP_CRYPTOPRO_TLSEXT_BUG constant.
      This constant is added to SSL_OP_ALL, because it does nothing, if
      non-GOST ciphersuite is selected, and all implementation of GOST
      include compatibility with CryptoPro.
    
    9. Support for CertificateVerify message without length field. It is
       another CryptoPro bug, but support is made unconditional, because it
       does no harm for draft-conforming implementation.
    
    10. In tls1_mac extra copy of stream mac context is no more done.
      When I've written currently commited code I haven't read
      EVP_DigestSignFinal manual carefully enough and haven't noticed that
      it does an internal digest ctx copying.
    
    This implementation was tested against
    1. CryptoPro CSP 3.6 client and server
    2. Cryptopro CSP 3.0 server

    Basic idea behind explicit IV is to make it unpredictable for attacker.
    Until now it was xor between CBC residue and 1st block from last datagram,
    or in other words still predictable.

Author: Bodo Möller <bodo@openssl.org>
Date:   Fri Sep 21 06:54:24 2007 +0000

    Implement the Opaque PRF Input TLS extension
    (draft-rescorla-tls-opaque-prf-input-00.txt), and do some cleanups and
    bugfixes on the way.  In particular, this fixes the buffer bounds
    checks in ssl_add_clienthello_tlsext() and in ssl_add_serverhello_tlsext().
    
    Note that the opaque PRF Input TLS extension is not compiled by default;
    see CHANGES.

    As for inline vs. __inline. The original code implies that most compilers
    understand inline, while WIN32 ones insist on __inline. Well, there are
    other compilers that insist on __inline. At the same time it turned out
    that most compilers understand both __inline and inline. I could find
    only one that doesn't understand __inline, Sun C. In other words it seems
    that __inline as preferred choice provides better coverage...

Author: Bodo Möller <bodo@openssl.org>
Date:   Mon Feb 19 18:41:41 2007 +0000

    Include "!eNULL" in SSL_DEFAULT_CIPHER_LIST to make sure that a
    ciphersuite string such as "DEFAULT:RSA" cannot enable
    authentication-only ciphersuites.
    
    Also, change ssl_create_cipher_list() so that it no longer
    starts with an arbitrary ciphersuite ordering, but instead
    uses the logic that we previously had in SSL_DEFEAULT_CIPHER_LIST.
    SSL_DEFAULT_CIPHER_LIST simplifies into just "ALL:!aNULL:!eNULL".

commit 52b8dad8ec6eb0dcada52851af5f9498af7a91be
Author: Bodo Möller <bodo@openssl.org>
Date:   Sat Feb 17 06:45:38 2007 +0000

    Reorganize the data used for SSL ciphersuite pattern matching.
    This change resolves a number of problems and obviates multiple kludges.
    A new feature is that you can now say "AES256" or "AES128" (not just
    "AES", which enables both).
    
    In some cases the ciphersuite list generated from a given string is
    affected by this change.  I hope this is just in those cases where the
    previous behaviour did not make sense.

    Experimental streaming PKCS#7 support.
    
    I thought it was about time I dusted this off. This stuff had been sitting on
    my hard drive for *ages* (2003 in fact). Hasn't been tested well and may not
    work properly.
    
    Nothing uses it at present which is just as well.
    
    Think of this as a traditional Christmas present which looks far more
    impressive in the adverts and on the box, some of the bits are missing and
    falls to bits if you play with it too much.

    Fixes for the following claims:
    
      1) Certificate Message with no certs
    
      OpenSSL implementation sends the Certificate message during SSL
      handshake, however as per the specification, these have been omitted.
    
      -- RFC 2712 --
         CertificateRequest, and the ServerKeyExchange shown in Figure 1
         will be omitted since authentication and the establishment of a
         master secret will be done using the client's Kerberos credentials
         for the TLS server.  The client's certificate will be omitted for
         the same reason.
      -- RFC 2712 --
    
      3) Pre-master secret Protocol version
    
      The pre-master secret generated by OpenSSL does not have the correct
      client version.
    
      RFC 2712 says, if the Kerberos option is selected, the pre-master
      secret structure is the same as that used in the RSA case.
    
      TLS specification defines pre-master secret as:
             struct {
                 ProtocolVersion client_version;
                 opaque random[46];
             } PreMasterSecret;
    
      where client_version is the latest protocol version supported by the
      client
    
      The pre-master secret generated by OpenSSL does not have the correct
      client version. The implementation does not update the first 2 bytes
      of random secret for Kerberos Cipher suites. At the server-end, the
      client version from the pre-master secret is not validated.

    Reimplement outer rounds as "compact" in x86 assembler. This has rather
    strong impact on decrypt performance, 20-25%. One probably should consider
    switching between slower and faster routines depending on how much data
    we were asked to process.

    There is should be no need to rewind the input stream any more.
    
    For S/MIME multipart/signed type the signature is calculated on the fly.
    
    For other detached data forms the stream isn't used after the single pass to
    calculate signatures.
    
    For non-detached the data is stored in a memory BIO.

    As an effect of revisions 1.261, BUILD_CMD was changed so $(DIRS)
    wasn't respected when using it to build different parts of OpenSSL.
    1.269 was an attempt to correct that, but unfortunately meant that we
    built every part that was given i $(DIRS) 7 times.  This change puts
    back the original intent with BUILD_CMD via the new macro
    BUILD_ONE_CMD while keeping the intent with RECURSIVE_BUILD_CMD.

Date:   Fri Dec 16 10:37:24 2005 +0000

    Eliminate warning induced by http://cvs.openssl.org/chngview?cn=14690 and
    keep disclaiming narrower than 32-bit support.

commit 6df8c74d5bc9504da54ae54bd3144aef2cb9b1bc
Author: Andy Polyakov <appro@openssl.org>
Date:   Thu Dec 15 22:40:58 2005 +0000

    Switch 64-bit sparcv9 platforms from bn(64,64) to bn(64,32). This doesn't
    have impact on performance, because amount of multiplications does not
    increase with this switch, not on sparcv9 that is. On the contrary, it
    actually improves performance, because it spares a load of instructions
    used to chase carries. Not to mention that BN assembler modules can be
    shared more freely between 32- and 64-bit builts.

    This update implements following improvements.
    
    1. Original submission required minor modification to RC4_set_key, which
       we don't want to tolerate and therefore we fix assembler instead.
    2. Eliminate remaining byte-order dependence [look for RC4_BIG_ENDIAN].
    3. Eliminate logical error [when key->x is referred prior key is verified].
    4. HP-UX assembler puked on MODSCHED_RC4 macro with "syntax error,"
       macro has to be splitted in two.
    5. Deploy parallel compare in function prologue.
    6. Eliminate redundant instuctions and nops.
    7. Eliminate assembler warnings.

    Omit padding in RC4_KEY on IA-64. The idea behind padding was to reserve
    room for aligning of the key schedule itself [specific alignment is
    required for future performance improvements], but OpenSSH "abuses"
    our API by making copies and restoring RC4_KEY, thus ruining the
    alignment and making it impossible to recover the key schedule.

    This is follow-up to the patch introducing common BUILDENV. Idea is
    to collect as much parameters in $(TOP) as possible and "strip" lower
    Makefiles for most variables [and thus makes them more readable].

    Netware patch submitted by Verdon Walker" <VWalker@novell.com> in PR
    1107.  He says:
    
    This is a followup to the NetWare patch that was applied to beta3.  It
    does the following:
    
    - Fixes a problem in the CLib build with undefined symbols.
    
    - Adds the ability to use BSD sockets as the default for the OpenSSL
      socket BIO.  NetWare supports 2 flavors of sockets and our Apache
      developers need BSD sockets as a configurable option when building
      OpenSSL.  This adds that for them.
    
    - Updates to the INSTALL.NW file to explain new options.
    
    I have tried very hard to make sure all the changes are in NetWare
    specific files or guarded carefully to make sure they only impact
    NetWare builds.  I have tested the Windows build to make sure it does
    not break that since we have made changes to mk1mf.pl.
    
    We are still working the gcc cross compile for NetWare issue and hope
    to have a patch for that before beta 6 is released.

    Handle differences between engine IDs and their dynamic library names (and
    source files, for that matter) by tolerating the alternatives. It would be
    preferable to also change the generated shared library names, but that will
    be taken up separately.

    It seems like mkdef.pl couldn't quite understand that #ifdef OPENSSL_NO_SHA512
    was still active when it came down to the functions.  mkdef.pl should really
    be corrected, but that'll be another day...

    Engage Applink in mingw. Note that application-side module is not
    compiled into *our* aplpications. That's because mingw is always
    consistent with itself. Having library-side code linked into .dll
    makes it possible to deploy the .dll with user-code compiled with
    another compiler [which is pretty much the whole point behind Applink].

    Some C compilers produce warnings or compilation errors if an attempt
    is made to directly cast a function of one type to what it considers and
    incompatible type. In particular gcc 3.4.2.
    
    Add new openssl_fcast macro to place functions into a form where the compiler
    will allow them to be cast.
    
    The current version achives this by casting to: void function(void).

    I was incorrect about VMS/Alpha.  Defining BN_LLONG with
    SIXTY_FOUR_BIT could cause havoc, so don't (it's lucky bn.h undefines
    BN_LLONG when SIXTY_FOUR_BIT is defined).

Author: Richard Levitte <levitte@openssl.org>
Date:   Fri May 6 13:34:35 2005 +0000

    Since BN_LLONG will only be defined for Alpha/VMS and not VAX/VMS,
    there's no need to undefine it here.  Then, let's get a bit paranoid
    and not define BN_ULLONG on THIRTY_TWO_BIT machines when BN_LLONG
    isn't defined.

    Actually, C on VMS/Alpha knows very well what a long long is, and
    knows how to make use of it.  So let's stop pretending the Alpha
    doesn't know long long...

    This one deserves a note.  In the change to CHANGES, there's the
    following:
    
    +     NOTE: This is for the 0.9.7 series ONLY.  This hack will never
    +     appear in 0.9.8 or later.  We EXPECT application authors to have
    +     dealt properly with this when 0.9.8 is released (unless we actually
    +     make such changes in the libcrypto locking code that changes will
    +     have to be made anyway).
    
    That makes this one a false positive.

    first step to melt down ChangeLog.0_9_7-stable_not-in-head :-)

commit 2757c67da2c68d8757cf4314993f7b46f5a351f5
Author: Bodo Möller <bodo@openssl.org>
Date:   Mon Apr 25 21:01:31 2005 +0000

    This is a collection of those CVS change log entries for the 0.9.7
    branch (OpenSSL_0_9_7-stable) that do not appear similarly in
    0.9.8-dev (CVS head).
    
    Some obvious false positives have been eliminated: e.g., we do not
    care about a simple "make update"; and we don't care about changes
    identified to the 0.9.7 branch that were explicitly identified as
    backports from head.
    
    Eliminating all other entries (and finally this file), either as false
    positives or as things that should go into 0.9.8, remains to be done.

    Mitigate cache-timing attack in CBC mode. This is done by implementing
    compressed tables (2x compression factor) and by pre-fetching them into
    processor cache prior every CBC en-/decryption pass. One can argue why
    just CBC? Well, it's commonly used mode in real-life applications and
    API allows us to amortize the prefetch costs for larger data chunks...

    Change ./Configure so that certain algorithms can be disabled by default.
    This is now the case for RC5.
    
    As a side effect, the OPTIONS in the Makefile will usually look a
    little different now, but they are essentially only for information
    anyway.

    The mix of CFLAGS and LDFLAGS is a bit confusing in my opinion, and
    Makefile.shared was a bit overcomplicated.
    
    Make the shell variables LDFLAGS and SHAREDFLAGS in Makefile.shared
    get the values of $(CFLAGS) or $(LDFLAGS) as appropriate depending on
    the value the shell variables LDCMD and SHAREDCMD get.  That leaves
    much less chance of confusion, since those pairs of shell variables
    always are defined together.

    Default to AES u32 being unsinged int and not long. This improves cache
    locality on 64-bit platforms (and fixes IA64 assembler-empowered build:-).
    The choice is guarded by newly introduced AES_LONG macro, which needs
    to be defined only on 16-bit platforms which we don't support (not that
    I know of). Meaning that one could as well skip long option altogether.

    Changes concering RFC 3820 (proxy certificates) integration:
    
     - Enforce that there should be no policy settings when the language
       is one of id-ppl-independent or id-ppl-inheritAll.
     - Add functionality to ssltest.c so that it can process proxy rights
       and check that they are set correctly.  Rights consist of ASCII
       letters, and the condition is a boolean expression that includes
       letters, parenthesis, &, | and ^.
     - Change the proxy certificate configurations so they get proxy
       rights that are understood by ssltest.c.
     - Add a script that tests proxy certificates with SSL operations.
    
    Other changes:
    
     - Change the copyright end year in mkerr.pl.
     - make update.

    than the original implementation...

    Make an explicit check during certificate validation to see that the
    CA setting in each certificate on the chain is correct.  As a side-
    effect always do the following basic checks on extensions, not just
    when there's an associated purpose to the check:
    - if there is an unhandled critical extension (unless the user has
      chosen to ignore this fault)
    - if the path length has been exceeded (if one is set at all)
    - that certain extensions fit the associated purpose (if one has been
      given)

    RC4 tune-up for Intel P4 core, both 32- and 64-bit ones. As it's
    apparently impossible to compose blended code with would perform
    satisfactory on all x86 and x86_64 cores, an extra RC4_CHAR
    code-path is introduced and P4 core is detected at run-time. This
    way we keep original performance on non-P4 implementations and
    turbo-charge P4 performance by factor of 2.8x (on 32-bit core).

    Because -rpath/-R may have been used, our settings of LD_LIBRARY_PATH
    and friends may be entirely useless.  In such a case, LD_PRELOAD is
    the answer, at least on platforms using LD_LIBRARY_PATH.  There might
    be other variables to set on other platforms, please fill us in...
    
    For now, we only do this with the tests, so they won't fail for silly
    reasons like getting dynamically linked to older installed libraries
    rather than the newly built ones...

    Because libraries on Windows lack useful version information, the zlib
    guys had to change the name to differentiate with older versions when
    a backward incompatibility came up.  Of course, we need to adapt.
    This change simply tries to load the library through the newer name
    (ZLIB1) first, and if that fails, it tries the good old ZLIB.

    Define my own macro LP_ENTRY_SIZE to express the size of my own
    buffering of directory entries, and make it depend on whichever comes
    first of PATH_MAX and NAME_MAX.  As a fallback, make sure it's set to
    255 if neither PATH_MAX or NAME_MAX were defined.  Also, if the size
    given from PATH_MAX or NAME_MAX is less than 255, force LP_ENTRY_SIZE
    to be 255.
    
    It makes no harm whatsoever if LP_ENTRY_SIZE is larger than the
    maximum local path name limit.  It does make a lot of harm if
    LP_ENTRY_SIZE is smaller.  255 seemed like a fairly acceptable default
    when nothing else is available.

    On systems that use case-insensitive symbol names (i.e. they're all

    DLLEntryPoint is a collective name, not what linker looks for. However,
    if we explicitly intruct the linker to set entry point, then we become
    obliged to initialize run-time library. Instead we can pick name run-time

    This is so to say "damage control" for jumbo "cpuid" patch, see
    http://cvs.openssl.org/chngview?cn=12493. Now all platform should
    be operational, while SSE2 code pathes get engaged on ELF platforms
    only.

commit 14e21f863a3e3278bb8660ea9844e92e52e1f2f7
Author: Andy Polyakov <appro@openssl.org>
Date:   Mon Jul 26 20:18:55 2004 +0000

    Add framework for yet another assembler module dubbed "cpuid." Idea
    is to have a placeholder to small routines, which can be written only
    in assembler. In IA-32 case this includes processor capability
    identification and access to Time-Stamp Counter. As discussed earlier
    OPENSSL_ia32cap is introduced to control recently added SSE2 code
    pathes (see docs/crypto/OPENSSL_ia32cap.pod). For the moment the
    code is operational on ELF platforms only. I haven't checked it yet,
    but I have all reasons to believe that Windows build should fail to
    link too. I'll be looking into it shortly...

    Quite. I'm also removing the older commented-out implementations to improve

    BN_div_word() was breaking when called from BN_bn2dec() (actually, this is

    OPENSSL_NO_DEPRECATED that is).

commit f15390bdb45637f36266e36ea0967a4456ff7008
Author: Geoff Thorpe <geoff@openssl.org>
Date:   Mon May 17 18:56:15 2004 +0000

    The inclusion of bn.h from the engine.h API header has been deprecated, so
    the engine implementations need to include bn.h to manipulate bignums.

commit d095b68d63ca91d8e42afb5dc46bb16ed4e4e25d
Author: Geoff Thorpe <geoff@openssl.org>
Date:   Mon May 17 18:53:47 2004 +0000

    Deprecate quite a few recursive includes from the ssl.h API header and
    remove some unnecessary includes from the internal header ssl_locl.h. This
    then requires adding includes for bn.h in four C files.

    Deprecate some recursive includes from the store.h API header, and put back
    required includes back via the internal header and str_lib.c.

    The problem of rsa key-generation getting stuck in a loop for (pointlessly)
    small key sizes seems to result from the code continually regenerating the
    same prime value once the range is small enough. From my tests, this change
    fixes the problem by setting an escape velocity of 3 repeats for the second
    of the two primes.

    Reduce header interdependencies, initially in engine.h (the rest of the
    changes are the fallout). As this could break source code that doesn't
    directly include headers for interfaces it uses, changes to recursive
    includes are covered by the OPENSSL_NO_DEPRECATED symbol. It's better to
    define this when building and using openssl, and then adapt code where
    necessary - this is how to stay current. However the mechanism exists for
    the lethargic.

    This is essentially Intel 32-bit compiler tune-up. To start with all
    available compiler versions generated bogus machine code trying to
    compile new crypto/des/cfb_enc.c. Secondly, 8th version defines
    __GNUC__ macro, but fails to compile *some* inline assembler correctly.
    Note that all versions of icc implement MSC-like _lrot[rl] intrinsic,
    which is used now instead of offensive asm. Finally, unnecessary linker
    dependencies are eliminated. Most notably dependency from libirc.a
    caused trouble at application start-up, if libcrypto.so is linked with
    -Bsymbolic (which it is).

    Adjust various bignum functions to use BN_CTX for variables instead of
    locally initialising their own.
    
    NB: I've removed the "BN_clear_free()" loops for the exit-paths in some of
    these functions, and that may be a major part of the performance
    improvements we're seeing. The "free" part can be removed because we're
    using BN_CTX. The "clear" part OTOH can be removed because BN_CTX
    destruction automatically performs this task, so performing it inside
    functions that may be called repeatedly is wasteful. This is currently safe
    within openssl due to the fact that BN_CTX objects are never created for
    longer than a single high-level operation. However, that is only because
    there's currently no mechanism in openssl for thread-local storage. Beyond
    that, this might be an issue for applications using the bignum API directly
    and caching their own BN_CTX objects. The solution is to introduce a flag
    to BN_CTX_start() that allows its variables to be automatically sanitised
    on release during BN_CTX_end(). This way any higher-level function (and
    perhaps the application) can specify this flag in its own
    BN_CTX_start()/BN_CTX_end() pair, and this will cause inner-loop functions
    specifying the flag to be ignored so that sanitisation is handled only once
    back out at the higher level. I will be implementing this in the near
    future.

    Replace the BN_CTX implementation with my current work. I'm leaving the
    little TODO list in there as well as the debugging code (only enabled if
    BN_CTX_DEBUG is defined).
    
    I'd appreciate as much review and testing as can be spared for this. I'll
    commit some changes to other parts of the bignum code shortly to make
    better use of this implementation (no more fixed size limitations). Note
    also that under identical optimisations, I'm seeing a noticable speed
    increase over openssl-0.9.7 - so any feedback to confirm/deny this on other
    systems would also be most welcome.

    By adding a BN_CTX parameter to the 'rsa_mod_exp' callback, private key
    operations no longer require two distinct BN_CTX structures. This may put
    more "strain" on the current BN_CTX implementation (which has a fixed limit
    to the number of variables it will hold), but so far this limit is not
    triggered by any of the tests pass and I will be changing BN_CTX in the
    near future to avoid this problem anyway.
    
    This also changes the default RSA implementation code to use the BN_CTX in
    favour of initialising some of its variables locally in each function.

      make bugs less likely rather than fixing them: bn_expand() macro,
      bn_expand_internal(), and BN_sqr().
    - Deprecate bn_dup_expand() - it's new since 0.9.7, unused, and not that
      useful.
    - Remove unnecessary zeroing of unused bytes in bn_expand2().
    - Rewrite BN_set_word() - it should be much simpler, the previous
      complexities probably date from old mismatched type issues.
    - Add missing bn_check_top() macros in bn_word.c
    - Improve some degenerate case handling in BN_[add|sub]_word(), add
      comments, and avoid a bignum expansion if an overflow isn't possible.

    The efforts to eliminate the dual-representation of zero and to ensure
    bignums are passed in and out of functions and APIs in a consistent form
    has highlighted that zero-valued bignums don't need any allocated word
    data. The use of BN_set_word() to initialise a bignum to zero causes
    needless allocation and gives it a return value that must be checked. This
    change converts BN_zero() to a self-contained macro that has no
    return/expression value and does not cause any expansion of bignum data.
    
    Note, it would be tempting to rewrite the deprecated version as a
    success-valued comma expression, such as;
       #define BN_zero(a) ((a)->top = (a)->neg = 0, 1)
    However, this evaluates 'a' twice and would confuse initialisation loops
    (eg. while(..) { BN_zero(bn++) } ). As such, the deprecated version
    continues to use BN_set_word().

    More changes coming out of the bignum auditing. BN_CTX_get() should ideally
    return a "zero" bignum as BN_new() does - so reset 'top'. During
    BN_CTX_end(), released bignums should be consistent so enforce this in
    debug builds. Also, reduce the number of wasted BN_clear_free() calls from
    BN_CTX_end() (typically by 75% or so).

    Even though C specification explicitly says that constant type "stretches"
    automatically to accomodate the value, some compilers fail to do so. Most
    notably 0x0123456789ABCDEF should come out as long long in 32-bit context,
    but HP compiler truncates it to 32-bit value. Which in turn breaks GF(2^m)
    arithmetics in hpux-parisc2-cc build. Therefore this fix...

    SHA-1 assembler tune-up for Intel P4

    Adding a slash between the directoryt and the file is a problem with
    VMS.  The C RTL can handle it well if the "directory" is a logical
    name with no colon, therefore ending being 'logname/file'.  However,
    if the given logical names actually has a colon, or if you use a full
    VMS-syntax directory, you end up with 'logname:/file' or
    'dev:[dir1.dir2]/file', and that isn't handled in any good way.
    
    So, on VMS, we need to check if the directory string ends with a
    separator (one of ':', ']' or '>' (< and > can be used instead [ and
    ])), and handle that by not inserting anything between the directory
    spec and the file name.  In all other cases, it's assumed the
    directory spec is a logical name, so we need to place a colon between
    it and the file.

    BN_FLG_FREE is of extremely dubious usefulness, and is only referred to
    once in the source (where it is set for the benefit of no other code

    made the use of the flag conditional in bn_lib.c. Note, this change also
    NULLs the 'd' pointer in a BIGNUM when it is reset but not deallocated.

    which, in turn, are used nowhere at all. This is a good thing because
    bn_set_max() would currently generate code that wouldn't compile (BIGNUM
    has no 'max' element).
    
    The only apparent use for bn_set_[low|high] would be for implementing
    windowing algorithms, and all of openssl's seem to use bn_***_words()
    helpers instead (including the BN_div() that Nils fixed recently, which had
    been using independently-coded versions of what these unused macros are
    intended for). I'm therefore consigning these macros to cvs oblivion in the
    name of readability.

    bn_fix_top() exists for compatibility's sake and is mapped to
    bn_correct_top() or bn_check_top() depending on debug settings. For
    internal source, all bn_fix_top()s should be converted one way or the other
    depending on whether the use of bn_correct_top() is justified.
    
    For BN_div_recp(), these cases should not require correction if the other
    bignum functions are doing their jobs properly, so convert to
    bn_check_top().

    Submitter's comment:
    
    This patch:
    
    a) Introduces a new file os2/backwardify.pl.
    
    b) Introduces a new mk1mf.pl variable $preamble.  As you can see, it may
       be used also to move some OS-specific code to VC-CE too (the the
       first chunk of the patch);
    
    c) The DESCRIPTION specifier of the .def file is made more informative:
       now it contains the version number too.  On OS/2 it is made conformant
       to OS/2 conventions; in particular, when one runs the standard command
    	BLDLEVEL this.DLL
       one can see:
    
       Vendor:      www.openssl.org/
       Revision:    0.9.7c
       Description: OpenSSL: implementation of Secure Socket Layer; DLL for library crypto.  Build for EMX -Zmtd
    
       [I did not make Win32 descriptions as informative as this - I'm afraid to
        break something.  Be welcome to fix this.]
    
    d) On OS/2 the generated DLL was hardly usable (it had a shared initialized
       data segment).
    
    e) On OS/2 the generated DLLs had names like ssl.dll.  However, DLL names on
       OS/2 are "global data".  It is hard to have several DLLs with the same
       name on the system.  Thus this precluded coexistence of OpenSSL with DLLs
       for other SLL implementations - or other name clashes.  I transparently
       changed the names of the DLLs to open_ssl.dll and cryptssl.dll.
    
    f) The file added in (a) is used to create "forwarder" DLLs, so the
       applications expecting the "old" DLL names may use the new DLLs
       transparently.  (A presence of these DLLs on the system nullifies (e),
       but makes old applications work.  This is a stopgap measure until the
       old applications are relinked.  Systems with no old applications do not
       need these DLLs, so may enjoy all the benefits of (e).)
    
       The new DLLs are placed in os2/ and os2/noname subdirectories.
    
    g) The makefiles created with os2/OS2-EMX.cmd did not work (some mysterious
       meaningless failures).  The change to util/pl/OS2-EMX.pl uses the
       variable introduced in (b) to switch the Makefiles to SHELL=sh syntax.
       All these backslashes are removed, and the generated Makefiles started to
       work.
    
    h) Running os2/OS2-EMX.cmd now prints out what to do next.

    This rewrites two "for" loops in BN_rshift() - equality with zero is

    This is a revert of my previous commit to "improve" the declaration of
    constant BIGNUMs. It turns out that this trips up different but equally
    useful compiler warnings to -Wcast-qual, and so wasn't worth the ugliness
    it created. (Thanks to Ulf for the forehead-slap.)

    This is the least unacceptable way I've found for declaring the bignum data
    and structures as constant without having to cast away const at any point.
    There is still plenty of other code that makes gcc's "-Wcast-qual" unhappy,
    but crypto/bn/ is now ok. Purists are welcome to suggest alternatives.

    bn_div() does some pretty nasty things with temporary variables,
    constructing BIGNUM structures with pointers offset into other bignums
    (among other things). This corrects some of it that is too plainly insane,
    and tries to ensure that bignums are normalised when passed to other
    functions.

    When a BN_CTX is used for temporary workspace, the variables are sometimes
    left in an inconsistent state when they are released for later reuse. This
    change resets the BIGNUMs when they are released back to the context.

    A general spring-cleaning (in autumn) to fix up signed/unsigned warnings.
    I have tried to convert 'len' type variable declarations to unsigned as a
    means to address these warnings when appropriate, but when in doubt I have
    used casts in the comparisons instead. The better solution (that would get
    us all lynched by API users) would be to go through and convert all the
    function prototypes and structure definitions to use unsigned variables
    except when signed is necessary. The proliferation of (signed) "int" for
    strictly non-negative uses is unfortunate.

commit 2ce90b9b7481381dff584726d84345a0260ca4d1
Author: Geoff Thorpe <geoff@openssl.org>
Date:   Wed Oct 29 18:04:37 2003 +0000

    BN_CTX is opaque and the static initialiser BN_CTX_init() is not used
    except internally to the allocator BN_CTX_new(), as such this deprecates
    the use of BN_CTX_init() in the API. Moreover, the structure definition of
    BN_CTX is taken out of bn_lcl.h and moved into bn_ctx.c itself.
    
    NDEBUG should probably only be "forced" in the top-level configuration, but
    until it is I will avoid removing it from bn_ctx.c which might surprise
    people with massive slow-downs in their keygens. So I've left it in
    bn_ctx.c but tidied up the preprocessor logic a touch and made it more
    tolerant of debugging efforts.

    Relax some over-zealous constification that gave some lhash-based code no
    choice but to have to cast away "const" qualifiers from their prototypes.
    This does not remove constification restrictions from hash/compare
    callbacks, but allows destructor commands to be run over a tables' elements
    without bad casts.

    For whatever reason (compiler or header bugs), at least one commonly-used
    linux system (namely mine) chokes on our definitions and uses of the "HZ"
    symbol in crypto/tmdiff.[ch] and apps/speed.c as a "bad function cast"
    (when in fact there is no function casting involved at all). In both cases,
    it is easily worked around by not defining a cast into the macro and
    jiggling the expressions slightly.
    
    In addition - this highlights some cruft in openssl that needs sorting out.
    The tmdiff.h header is exported as part of the openssl API despite the fact
    that it is ugly as the driven sludge and not used anywhere in the library,
    applications, or utilities. More weird still, almost identical code exists
    in apps/speed.c though it looks to be slightly tweaked - so either tmdiff
    should be updated and used by speed.c, or it should be dumped because it's
    obviously not useful enough.
    
    Rather than removing it for now, I've changed the API for tmdiff to at
    least make sense. This involves taking the object type (MS_TM) from the
    implementation and using it in the header rather than using "char *" in the
    API and casting mercilessly in the code (ugh). If someone doesn't like
    "MS_TM" and the "ms_time_***" naming, by all means change it. This should
    be a harmless improvement, because the existing API is clearly not very
    useful (eg. we reimplement it rather than using it in our own utils).
    
    However, someone still needs to take a hack at consolidating speed.c and
    tmdiff.[ch] somehow.

    When OPENSSL_NO_DEPRECATED is defined, deprecated functions are (or should
    be) precompiled out in the API headers. This change is to ensure that if
    it is defined when compiling openssl, the deprecated functions aren't
    implemented either.

    Fix prime generation loop in crypto/bn/bn_prime.pl by making
    sure the loop does correctly stop and breaking ("division by zero")
    modulus operations are not performed. The (pre-generated) prime
    table crypto/bn/bn_prime.h was already correct, but it could not be
    re-generated on some platforms because of the "division by zero"
    situation in the script.

    It seems like OpenUnix's ld uses LD_LIBRARY_PATH to search for
    libraries.  What's worse, the directories given in LD_LIBRARY_PATH are
    checked first!  Therefore, we need a hack to prepend all the
    directories we give with -L to the current value of LD_LIBRARY_PATH,
    thereby temporarly forming a hacked value.
    
    Only copy LIBEXTRAS if they are given.
    
    Svr5 doesn't use -z allextract...

    against DJGPP, and much more restricted than previous definitions.

commit 879650b866996f343e494ebe04503fedd534e5a2
Author: Geoff Thorpe <geoff@openssl.org>
Date:   Tue Mar 11 01:49:21 2003 +0000

    The default implementation of DSA_METHOD has an interdependence on the
    dsa_mod_exp() and bn_mod_exp() handlers from dsa_do_verify() and
    dsa_sign_setup(). When another DSA_METHOD implementation does not define
    these lower-level handlers, it becomes impossible to do a fallback to
    software on errors using a simple DSA_OpenSSL()->fn(key).
    
    This change allows the default DSA_METHOD to function in such circumstances
    by only using dsa_mod_exp() and bn_mod_exp() handlers if they exist,
    otherwise using BIGNUM implementations directly (which is what those
    handlers did before this change). There should be no noticable difference
    for the software case, or indeed any custom case that didn't already
    segfault, except perhaps that there is now one less level of indirection in
    all cases.

    Encryption BIOs misbehave when used with non blocking I/O.
    
    Two fixes:
    
    1. If BIO_write() fails inside enc_write() it should return the
       total number of bytes successfully written.
    
    2. If BIO_write() fails during BIO_flush() it should return immediately
       with the error code: previously it would fall through to the final
       encrypt, corrupting the buffer.

    Base64 bio fixes. The base64 bio was seriously broken
    when reading from a non blocking BIO.
    
    It would incorrectly interpret retries as EOF, incorrectly
    buffer initial data and have no buffering at all after initial
    data (data would be sent one byte at a time to EVP_DecodeUpdate).

    ECPublicKey_set_octet_string and ECPublicKey_get_octet_string
    behaviour was not quite consistent with the conventions
    for d2i and i2d functions as far as handling of the 'out'
    or 'in' pointer is concerned.
    
    This patch changes this behaviour, and renames the functions to
    o2i_ECPublicKey and i2o_ECPublicKey (not 'd2i' and 'i2d' because the
    external encoding is just a raw object string without any DER icing).

    We cache a montgomery form for 'n' if the PUBLIC flag is set, not PRIVATE.
    
    Also, I've added handling for other mod_exp calls that were not using any
    cached montgomery forms. These cases matter only for special RSA keys (eg.
    ones that are missing information) so are unlikely to be used in normal
    circumstances.

    David Brumley <dbrumley@stanford.edu> noted and corrected a case in the
    verification step of CRT private key operations in the RSA code -
    previously no montgomery form was checked or used for 'n', and so it would
    be generated on the fly each time. As a result, private key operations are
    now a percent or two faster.
    
    Rather than adding this as another repetition of the nearly-identical
    montgomery "check for first-use" initialisation code blocks, I've taken
    this chance to create a helper function and macro-wrapper to replace them.

    The OPENSSL_NO_ENGINE has small problem: it changes certain structures.  That's
    bad, so let's not check OPENSSL_NO_ENGINE in those places.  Fortunately, all
    the header files where the problem existed include ossl_typ.h, which makes
    a 'forward declaration' of the ENGINE type.

    This glues the GMP wrapper ENGINE into OpenSSL if it is being built (ie. if

    come first).

    Commit a slightly modified version of an old experiment to do RSA private

Date:   Thu Dec 19 19:39:30 2002 +0000

    If _XOPEN_SOURCE_EXTENDED or _XOPEN_SOURCE are defined, _POSIX_C_SOURCE gets
    defined in DECC$TYPES.H.  If _POSIX_C_SOURCE is defined, certain types do
    not get defined (u_char, u_int, ...).  DECC.H gets included by assert.h
    and others.  Now, in6.h uses the types u_char, u_int and so on, and gets
    included as part of other header inclusions, and will of course fail because
    of the missing types.
    
    On the other hand, _XOPEN_SOURCE_EXTENDED is needed to get gethostname()
    properly declared...
    
    Solution: define _XOPEN_SOURCE_EXTENDED much later, so DECC$TYPES.H has
    a chance to be included *first*, so the otherwise missing types get defined
    properly.
    
    Personal: *mumble* *mumble*

    Since HEADER_DES_H has been the protector of des.h since libdes
    (before SSLeay, maybe?), it's better to have that macro protect
    the compatibility header des_old.h.  In the new des.h, let's use
    a slightly different protecting macro.
    
    The rationale is that there are application that might include (via
    other header files, perhaps) both an old libdes des.h and OpenSSL's
    des.h.  Whichever comes first would overshadow the other because of
    the clash in protecting macro.  This fix solves that problem.

    Undefine OPENSSL_NO_DEPRECATED inside openssl application code if we are
    being built with it defined - it is not a symbol to affect how openssl
    itself builds, but to alter the way openssl headers can be used from an API
    point of view. The "deprecated" function wrappers will always remain inside
    OpenSSL at least as long as they're still being used internally. :-)
    
    The exception is dsaparam which has been updated to the BN_GENCB-based
    functions to test the new functionality. If GENCB_TEST is defined, dsaparam
    will support a "-timebomb <n>" switch to cancel parameter-generation if it
    gets as far as 'n' seconds without completion.

commit e9224c717711eefb30038c9b37c69795dda93c9a
Author: Geoff Thorpe <geoff@openssl.org>
Date:   Sun Dec 8 05:24:31 2002 +0000

    This is a first-cut at improving the callback mechanisms used in
    key-generation and prime-checking functions. Rather than explicitly passing
    callback functions and caller-defined context data for the callbacks, a new
    structure BN_GENCB is defined that encapsulates this; a pointer to the
    structure is passed to all such functions instead.
    
    This wrapper structure allows the encapsulation of "old" and "new" style
    callbacks - "new" callbacks return a boolean result on the understanding
    that returning FALSE should terminate keygen/primality processing.  The
    BN_GENCB abstraction will allow future callback modifications without
    needing to break binary compatibility nor change the API function
    prototypes. The new API functions have been given names ending in "_ex" and
    the old functions are implemented as wrappers to the new ones.  The
    OPENSSL_NO_DEPRECATED symbol has been introduced so that, if defined,
    declaration of the older functions will be skipped. NB: Some
    openssl-internal code will stick with the older callbacks for now, so
    appropriate "#undef" logic will be put in place - this is in case the user
    is *building* openssl (rather than *including* its headers) with this
    symbol defined.
    
    There is another change in the new _ex functions; the key-generation
    functions do not return key structures but operate on structures passed by
    the caller, the return value is a boolean. This will allow for a smoother
    transition to having key-generation as "virtual function" in the various
    ***_METHOD tables.

    I think I got it now.  Apparently, the case of having to shift down
    the divisor was a bit more complex than I first saw.  The lost bit
    can't just be discarded, as there are cases where it is important.
    For example, look at dividing 320000 with 80000 vs. 80001 (all
    decimals), the difference is crucial.  The trick here is to check if
    that lost bit was 1, and in that case, do the following:
    
    1. subtract the quotient from the remainder
    2. as long as the remainder is negative, add the divisor (the whole
       divisor, not the shofted down copy) to it, and decrease the
       quotient by one.
    
    There's probably a nice mathematical proof for this already, but I
    won't bother with that, unless someone requests it from me.

commit 711f1a3c266c9ff42e85553a96f36d744670630c
Author: Richard Levitte <levitte@openssl.org>
Date:   Mon Nov 18 23:54:27 2002 +0000

    Add the ASN.1 structures and functions for CertificatePair, which is
    defined as follows (according to X.509_4thEditionDraftV6.pdf):
    
    CertificatePair ::= SEQUENCE {
    	forward		[0]	Certificate OPTIONAL,
    	reverse		[1]	Certificate OPTIONAL,
    	-- at least one of the pair shall be present -- }
    
    The only thing I'm not sure about is if it's implicit or explicit tags
    that I should count on.  For now, I'm thinking explicit, but will
    gladly stand corrected.
    
    Also implement the PEM functions to read and write certificate pairs,
    and defined the PEM tag as "CERTIFICATE PAIR".
    
    This needed to be defined, mostly for the sake of the LDAP attribute
    crossCertificatePair, but may prove useful elsewhere as well.

    Correct and enhance the behaviour of "internal" session caching as it
    relates to SSL_CTX flags and the use of "external" session caching. The
    existing flag, "SSL_SESS_CACHE_NO_INTERNAL_LOOKUP" remains but is
    supplemented with a complimentary flag, "SSL_SESS_CACHE_NO_INTERNAL_STORE".
    The bitwise OR of the two flags is also defined as
    "SSL_SESS_CACHE_NO_INTERNAL" and is the flag that should be used by most
    applications wanting to implement session caching *entirely* by its own
    provided callbacks. As the documented behaviour contradicted actual
    behaviour up until recently, and since that point behaviour has itself been
    inconsistent anyway, this change should not introduce any compatibility
    problems. I've adjusted the relevant documentation to elaborate about how
    this works.
    
    Kudos to "Nadav Har'El" <nyh@math.technion.ac.il> for diagnosing these
    anomalies and testing this patch for correctness.

commit 0587ec264563249bbc26302aa1d5e9ff5f45d7f0

    If dynamically-loadable ENGINEs are linked against a shared-library version
    of libcrypto, then it is possible that when they are loaded they will share
    the same static data as the loading application/library. This means it will
    be too late to set memory/ERR/ex_data/[etc] callbacks, but entirely
    unnecessary to try. This change puts a static variable in the core ENGINE
    code (contained in libcrypto) and a function returning a pointer to it. If
    the loaded ENGINE's return value from this function matches the loading
    application/library's return value - they share static data. If they don't
    match, the loaded ENGINE has its own copy of libcrypto's static data and so
    the callbacks need to be set.
    
    Also, although 0.9.7 hasn't been released yet, it's clear this will
    introduce a binary incompatibility between dynamic ENGINEs built for 0.9.7
    and 0.9.8 (though others probably exist already from EC_*** hooks and
    what-not) - so the version control values are correspondingly bumped.

    The ENGINE implementations in ./engines/ should be role models on how to
    write external engines (and thus should require only installed openssl
    headers and libs to compile without warnings). So this gets rid of recently
    introduced compilation warnings (no longer including internal headers) by
    including string.h directly.

    - Remo Inverardi noticed that ENGINEs don't have an "up_ref" function in the

    So, I discovered that if you have your $PATH set so a ld different from
    GNU ld comes first, checking the usage of collect2 gives that instead of
    GNU ld, even if GNU ld would be the one that would get used if we link using
    gcc.  It's much better, apparently, to ask gcc directly what the path to
    GNU ld is (provided it's there at all and gcc knows about it), and ask
    the result if it's a GNU or not.  The bonus is that our GNU ld detection
    mechanism got shorter and easier to understand...

    In case of shared libraries, we might run one version of the
    application with a different version of the library.  Detect if there
    is a difference of versions, and print both versions in that case.
    This might prove to be a good enough debugging tool in case of doubt.

Date:   Mon Aug 5 16:27:01 2002 +0000

    These are updates/fixes to DH/DSA/RAND docs based on the fixes to the RSA
    docs. There were a couple of other places (including RSA) where the docs
    were not quite synchronised with the API that are now fixed. One or two
    still remain to be fixed though ...

Date:   Sun Aug 4 21:08:36 2002 +0000

    Various parts of the RSA documentation were inaccurate and out of date and
    this fixes those that I'm currently aware of. In particular, the ENGINE
    interference in the RSA API has hopefully been clarified. This still needs
    to be done for other areas of the API ...

    A single monolithic man page for the ENGINE stuff. This is a rough
    first-cut but provides better documentation than having nothing on the
    ENGINE API.

    Rename implementations of method functions so that they match
    the new method names where _GF... suffixes have been removed.
    
    Revert changes to ..._{get/set}_Jprojective_coordinates_...:
    The current implementation for ECC over binary fields does not use
    projective coordinates, and if it did, it would not use Jacobian
    projective coordinates; so it's OK to use the ..._GFp prefix for all
    this.
    
    Add author attributions to some files so that it doesn't look

    Move zeroing from bn_expand_internal() to bn_expand2() so that it
    happens reliably, even if the BIGNUM is already sufficiently large.
    
    [Note that the bn_expand()/bn_wexpand() macros call bn_expand2() only
    if the BIGNUM actually has to grow, so this change does not add any
    new overhead as currently bn_expand2() is never called directly.]

    definition:
    
    ":misfeature: /mis-fee'chr/ or /mis'fee`chr/ /n./  A feature
       that eventually causes lossage, possibly because it is not adequate
       for a new situation that has evolved.  Since it results from a
       deliberate and properly implemented feature, a misfeature is not a
       bug."

    For those wanting to build for several platforms with the same source

commit 7b63c0fa8c309bed7848b5ca5810ae9e2f2fb3c1
Author: Lutz Jänicke <jaenicke@openssl.org>
Date:   Wed Jul 10 07:01:54 2002 +0000

    Reorder inclusion of header files:
    
    des_old.h redefines crypt:
    #define crypt(b,s)\
            DES_crypt((b),(s))
    
    This scheme leads to failure, if header files with the OS's true definition
    of crypt() are processed _after_ des_old.h was processed. This is e.g. the
    case on HP-UX with unistd.h.
    As evp.h now again includes des.h (which includes des_old.h), this problem
    only came up after this modification.
    Solution: move header files (indirectly) including e_os.h before the header
    files (indirectly) including evp.h.

    A number of includes were removed from evp.h some time ago.  The reason
    was that they weren't really needed any more for EVP itself.  However,
    it seems like soma applications (I know about OpenSSH, but there may
    be more) used evp.h as the 'load all' header file, which makes sense
    since we try our best to promote the use of EVP instead of the lower
    level crypto algorithms.  Therefore, I put the inclusions back so
    the application authors don't get too shocked by all the errors they
    would otherwise get.
    
    Thanks to Theo de Raadt for making us aware of this.

    Support building the distribution .tar file on platforms with limited
    argument list length. This requires Gnu-tar. As we use the non-standard
    "tardy" software anyway, it doesn't hurt too much to require Gnu-tar.
    "make dist" will probably only be used by team-members anyway.

    Add config entry debug-steve-linux-pseudo64.  This sets the
    SIXTY_FOUR bignum library option to use 64 bit operations
    on the 32 bit linux platform.
    
    This is very inefficient but it can be used to test some
    of the 64 bit logic on a 32 bit platform.

    Fallback to normal multiply if n2 == 8 and dna or dnb is not zero
    in bn_mul_recursive.
    
    This is (hopefully) what was triggering bignum errors on 64 bit

    Make the engine config module always add dynamic ENGINEs
    to the list using dynamic_path. This stops ENGINEs which
    don't supply any default algorithms being automatically
    freed (because they have no references) and allows them
    to be accessed by id.
    
    Alternative dynamic loading behaviour can be achieved by
    issuing the dynamic ENGINE ctrls separately in the config file.

    Load config file in several openssl utilities.
    
    Most utilities now load modules from the config file,

    In the case of ca and req the config file used is
    the same as the utility itself: that is the -config
    command line option can be used to specify an
    alternative file.

    The AES modes OFB and CFB are defined with 128 feedback bits.  This
    deviates from the "standard" 64 bits of feedback that all other
    algorithms are using.  Therefore, let's redo certain EVP macros to
    accept different amounts of feedback bits for these modes.
    
    Also, change e_aes.c to provide all usually available modes for AES.
    CTR isn't included yet.

    The macro IMPLEMENT_ASN1_FUNCTIONS_const already contains an ending ;,
    so do not add one after the expansion, since ANSI C doesn't allow ;;
    at this level (or at least, so tells me gcc).

    Local `time' shadows the global function `time()'.  Rename the local
    variable to `tim' (and, as a matter of consequence, `time_d' to `tim_d').

    Because AEP and we used the same AEP_R_ prefix for error reasons,

    Add aep and sureware implementations and clean up some error reasons
    that were never part of the engine framework.
    
    The aep and sureware implementations are taken directly from 0.9.6c
    [engine] and have been modified to fit the newer engine framework and
    to be possible to build shared libraries of.
    
    The aep implementation has gone through quite a bunch of tests and is
    cleaned up (there were some misunderstandings in it about how to use
    locks).
    
    The sureware hasn't been tested at all in this incarnation and is
    basically a quick hack to get it to compile properly.

    With the changed des_old API, let's complete the work by renaming the
    functions in ui_compat.  This gave reason to rework that part more
    thoroughly, so here are the changes made:
    
    1. Add DES_read_password() and DES_read_2passwords() with the same
       functionality as the corresponding old des_ functions, as a
       convenience to the users.
    2. Add UI_UTIL_read_pw_string() and UI_UTIL_read_pw() with the
       functionality from des_read_pw_string() and des_read_pw(), again as
       a concenience to the users.
    3. Rename des_read_password(), des_read_2passwords(),
       des_read_pw_string() and des_read_pw() by changing des_ to
       _ossl_old_des_, and add the usual mapping macros.
    4. Move the implementation of des_read_password() and
       des_read_2passwords() to the des directory, since they are tightly
       tied to DES anyway.
    
    This change was inspired by a patch from Assar Westerlund <assar@sics.se>:
    
    There are some functions that didn't get the kick-away-old-des-and-
    replace-des-with-DES action.  Here's a patch that adds DES_ and des_
    (in des_old.h) versions of des_read_pw_string et al.  This patch
    includes some of the first des_old.h semi-colon macro fixes that I've
    already sent.

    Apply three patches from Assar Westerlund <assar@kth.se>:
    
    This patch makes the macros in des_old.h actually pretend to be
    functions.
    
    There's no reason not to define _ossl_old_crypt when using
    PERL5/FreeBSD/darwin/Next, since it makes using crypt and including
    des.h break.  Here's a trivial patch.
    
    This patch fixes some of the typos used in macro names in des_old.h
    and the number of arguments for some of them.

    HP-UX 32bit:
    * When linking against shared libraries, the absolute path is remembered.
      - When linking against -L.., '..' is remembered inside the executable,
        so it will fail after "make install" or when not called from inside the
        "apps/" subdirectory of the build tree.
      - When using the "+cdp" option of "ld", the ".." information can be
        exchanged against $(INSTALL_TOP)/lib. In this case the executable
        will however refuse to work before "make install" has been called.
        This makes testing the 'openssl' executable a problem.
    * Solution 1:
      Relink the "openssl" executable, when "make install" is called.
      This would however require significant changes to the toplevel Makefile
      and the apps/ Makefile.
    * Solution 2:
      Statically link against libssl and libcrypto, so that the "openssl"
      executable is no longer dependant on the openssl shared libraries.
    
    Select option 2 for HP-UX 32bit, as this requires the smallest change.

    I got some reports that some targets have weird dso_schemes.
    Therefore, I've added a sanity checker.
    
    Note that it can be combined with almost any other argument (the other
    arguments will be completely ignored), with "reconf" as the blatant
    exception, since it also has the behavior of ignoring all following
    command line arguments.  If --test-sanity and reconf are both used on
    the command line, the first one wins.

    I got a request to make the "old des" symbols more closely tied to
    OpenSSL.  Adding '_ossl' in the name seems to be a good way to do
    this.

    There is no aestest currently.  The EVP tester is used to check the
    AES algorithm.

commit f1c2a9de458b175dd6831cb742b34a7ef8d87aa8
Author: Geoff Thorpe <geoff@openssl.org>
Date:   Fri Jan 25 03:13:50 2002 +0000

    The 'type' parameter, an EVP_MD pointer, represents the type of digest
    required as well as a default implementation (when no ENGINE provides a
    replacement implementation). This change makes sure the correct
    implementation's "init()" handler is used rather than assuming 'type'.

    Use FIPS-197 vectors for AES.  The NIST vectors were constructed by
    reencrypting or redecrypting the ciphertext 10000 times, which of
    course gives higly different results.

Author: Richard Levitte <levitte@openssl.org>
Date:   Mon Jan 21 16:09:45 2002 +0000

    Add more of the NIST test vectors for AES.
    
    For some reason, they give incorrect results with the OpenSSL

    Bugfix: In ssl3_accept, don't use a local variable 'got_new_session'

    - Network errors could pollute the buffers because -1 isn't noticed in an
      "unsigned int".
    - Remove redundant processing with machine->ssl is NULL.
    - Remove compiler warnings about uninitialised 'ctx' (it's not used
      uninitialised, but gcc can't see that).

    Implement speed measurement for AES.
    Submitted by Stephen Sprunk <stephen@sprunk.org> as part of his AES
    integration patch.

commit 6f9079fd505c28961049a732e33e662530bdad21
Author: Richard Levitte <levitte@openssl.org>
Date:   Wed Jan 2 16:55:35 2002 +0000

    Because Rijndael is more known as AES, use crypto/aes instead of
    crypto/rijndael.  Additionally, I applied the AES integration patch
    from Stephen Sprunk <stephen@sprunk.org> and fiddled it to work
    properly with the normal EVP constructs (and incidently work the same
    way as all other symmetric cipher implementations).
    
    This results in an API that looks a lot like the rest of the OpenSSL
    cipher suite.

    Allow 8-bit characters.  This is not really complete, it only marks
    characters with the highest bit set as HIGHBIT.  We need to expand
    this to support the UTF-8 character set properly.  However, this
    solves the problem that the character 0x80 (which is common in UTF-8)
    gets masked to 0x00.

    UID was never a lable for uniqueIdentifier.  However, LDAP and certain
    RFCs concerning X.500 directories use UID as a shorter name for the
    attribute type userId, which is defined by CCITT and available through
    RFCs 1274 and 2247.
    
    Unfortunately, if some applications have used the name "UID" for the
    uniqueIdentifier attribute type, they will produce incorrect results.
    However, I found it better to follow the standards that are out there
    rather than having our own incompatible one.

    When the "dynamic" ENGINE loads another ENGINE from a shared-library, it
    essentially overwrites itself with the new ENGINE, with the exception of
    reference counts, ex_data structures, and other 'admin' elements. However
    if the new ENGINE doesn't populate certain elements, there's the risk of
    the "dynamic" ENGINE's elements showing through - the "cmd_defns" were just
    one of the possibilities. This implements a more comprehensive cleanup.

    The "openssl" ENGINE is no longer used except as a testing/debugging
    device. This change enables it for building as a self-contained "dynamic"
    ENGINE, to help testing such mechanisms.

    If an engine isn't built in, try loading it as a shareable library
    instead.  This also makes it possible for users to simply give said
    shareable library as argument for the -engine option.

    In a Debian Linux environment, it's not a good idea, apparently, to
    manually declare the include directory /usr/include at the same time
    as the macro PROTOTYPES is defined with the value 1.  Besides,
    /usr/include is the standard include directory anyway, so there's no
    need to specify it explicitely.

    After loading a dynamic engine, reset the command definitions to the
    empty set.  This prevents engines that do not set the command
    definitions themselves to inherit the ones from "dynamic", which would
    otherwise be very confusing.

commit c2e4f17c1a0d4d5115c6ede9492de1615fe392ac
Author: Richard Levitte <levitte@openssl.org>
Date:   Wed Oct 24 21:21:12 2001 +0000

    Due to an increasing number of clashes between modern OpenSSL and
    libdes (which is still used out there) or other des implementations,
    the OpenSSL DES functions are renamed to begin with DES_ instead of
    des_.  Compatibility routines are provided and declared by including
    openssl/des_old.h.  Those declarations are the same as were in des.h
    when the OpenSSL project started, which is exactly how libdes looked
    at that time, and hopefully still looks today.
    
    The compatibility functions will be removed in some future release, at
    the latest in version 1.0.

    Call msg_callback with correct length parameter if ssl3_write_bytes had to
    be called multiple times

commit a661b6535744f41b428bb35a7fc3e5747900e9ef
Author: Bodo Möller <bodo@openssl.org>
Date:   Sat Oct 20 17:56:36 2001 +0000

    New functions SSL[_CTX]_set_msg_callback().
    New macros SSL[_CTX]_set_msg_callback_arg().
    
    Message callback imlementation for SSL 3.0/TLS 1.0 (no SSL 2.0 yet).
    
    New '-msg' option for 'openssl s_client' and 'openssl s_server'
    that enable a message callback that displays all protocol messages.
    
    
    In ssl3_get_client_hello (ssl/s3_srvr.c), generate a fatal alert if
    client_version is smaller than the protocol version in use.
    Also change ssl23_get_client_hello (ssl/s23_srvr.c) to select TLS 1.0
    if the client demanded SSL 3.0 but only TLS 1.0 is enabled; then the
    client will at least see that alert.
    
    Fix SSL[_CTX]_ctrl prototype (void * instead of char * for generic
    pointer).
    
    Add/update some OpenSSL copyright notices.

Date:   Tue Oct 16 13:09:24 2001 +0000

    Add per-SSL 'msg_callback' with 'msg_callback_arg'.
    Both have per-SSL_CTX defaults.
    These new values can be set by calling SSL[_CTX]_[callback_]ctrl
    with codes SSL_CTRL_SET_MSG_CALLBACK and SSL_CTRL_SET_MSG_CALLBACK_ARG.
    
    So far, the callback is never actually called.
    
    
    Also rearrange some SSL_CTX struct members (some exist just in
    SSL_CTXs, others are defaults for SSLs and are either copied
    during SSL_new, or used if the value in the SSL is not set;
    these three classes of members were not in a logical order),
    and add some missing assignments to SSL_dup.

    The message header for fake SSL 3.0/TLS 1.0 client hellos created from
    SSL 2.0 client hellos added with the previous commit was totally wrong --
    it must start with the message type, not the protocol version.
    (Not that this particular header is actually used anywhere ...)

    The patch included in the original post may improve the internal session
    list handling (and is therefore worth a seperate investigation).
    No change to the list handling will however solve the problems of incorrect
    SSL_SESSION_free() calls. The session list is only one possible point of
    failure, dangling pointers would also occur for SSL object currently
    using the session. The correct solution is to only use SSL_SESSION_free()
    when applicable!

    In certain cases, no encoding has been set up for the b64 filter.  In
    such cases, a flush should *not* attempt to finalise the encoding, as
    the EVP_ENCODE_CTX structure will only be filled with garbage.  For
    the same reason, do the same check when a wpending is performed.

    For systems where gcc is used and where we don't know if GNU ld is
    used or not, let's ask collect2 which ld it uses and choose to use the
    target do-gnu_shared if GNU ld is used.
    
    This solves the reported problems on Solaris systems where GNU cc is
    used but GNU ld isn't, and probably on other systems with similar
    setups.

    It seems like gcc does canonicalisation of file names.  More
    specifically, a starting './' is removed.  makedepend doesn't do this,
    resulting in another possible commit war, so let's fix that by doing a
    poor mans canonicalisation of file names that gives the same effect as
    doing dependencies through gcc.

    Change some EVP prototypes to use "cipher" rather than "type" as a variable

    EVP_EncryptInit_ex() and EVP_DecryptInit_ex() had been defined in evp.h but
    not implemented. (Bug reported by Martin Szotkowski)
    
    This also changes the non-"_ex" versions to defer directly to
    EVP_CipherInit_ex() rather than EVP_CipherInit() to avoid an unecessary
    level of indirection.

    As ENGINE_load_openbsd_dev_crypto() is an API function, it makes sense for
    it to be defined on all platforms whether or not it is of any practical
    use on them. This also resolves linker problems on "special" platforms,
    such as win32.

    The cleanup stack in ENGINE changed slightly, so this "make update" is
    needed.

commit 5c32657c80d6d53618002019be679bc5816aef75
Author: Geoff Thorpe <geoff@openssl.org>
Date:   Mon Oct 1 16:26:00 2001 +0000

    The STACK macros take care of casting to and from the designated item type
    of the stack, and the (void *) type used in the underlying sk_***
    functions.  However, declaring a STACK_OF(type) where type is a *function*
    type implicitly involves casts between function pointers and data pointers.
    That's a no-no. This changes the ENGINE_CLEANUP handling to use a regular
    data type in the stack.

    ENGINE_register_all_complete() will register all implementations of all
    algorithms present in all loaded ENGINEs. The result is that if any of
    those ENGINEs successfully initialises, and the ENGINE_TABLE_FLAG_NOINIT
    flag isn't set, then they will always be used (and cached as defaults) in
    preference to software implementations. Ie. accidental auto-detection of
    acceleration hardware :-)
    
    This change stops all implementations being automatically registered in
    "openssl" sub-commands, so that the "setup_engine()" handler in apps.c
    controls which ENGINEs are registered for use. A special case has been
    added that will revert to this "auto-detect" logic, ie. if the "-engine"
    switch is used as;
       -engine auto

    Two changes:
    
    1. if there are several symbols with the same entry number, sort those
       symbols in ASCII order.
    2. Do not stop reading the header files when "BEGIN ERROR CODES" is
       found, since mkerr.pl will add a function declaration after that
       comment.  Instead, trigger on "Error codes for the \w+ function",
       which is the actual start of the error code macros.
    
    Additionally, a few more debugging printouts that helped.

    "FALLBACK" handling was a hack that was thrown out long ago in the
    ENGINE redevelopment. The idea had been that "-1" could be used as a
    special "ask me later" 'nid' rather than specifying supported cipher and
    digest 'nid's up front. However the idea turned out to be pretty broken.

Author: Geoff Thorpe <geoff@openssl.org>
Date:   Tue Sep 25 21:41:20 2001 +0000

    This change adds dummy RC4 and SHA1 support to the "openssl" ENGINE for
    testing. Because of the recent changes (see crypto/engine/README), the
    "openssl" ENGINE is no longer needed nor is it loaded automatically or by
    ENGINE_load_builtin_engines(). So a explicit ENGINE_load_openssl() call is
    required by applications or a modification to eng_all.c before this ENGINE
    will be used. This change will send output to stderr as/when its
    implementations are used.

    This changes EVP's cipher and digest code to hook via the ENGINE support.
    See crypto/engine/README for details.
    
    - it also removes openbsd_hw.c from the build (that functionality is
      going to be available in the openbsd ENGINE in a upcoming commit)
    
    - evp_test has had the extra initialisation added so it will use (if
      possible) any ENGINEs supporting the algorithms required.

    This commits changes to various parts of libcrypto required by the recent
    ENGINE surgery. DH, DSA, RAND, and RSA now use *both* "method" and ENGINE
    pointers to manage their hooking with ENGINE. Previously their use of
    "method" pointers was replaced by use of ENGINE references. See
    crypto/engine/README for details.
    
    Also, remove the ENGINE iterations from evp_test - even when the
    cipher/digest code is committed in, this functionality would require a
    different set of API calls.

Author: Geoff Thorpe <geoff@openssl.org>
Date:   Tue Sep 25 20:00:51 2001 +0000

    This change replaces the ENGINE's underlying mechanics with the new
    ENGINE_TABLE-based stuff - as described in crypto/engine/README.
    
    Associated miscellaneous changes;
     - the previous cipher/digest hooks that hardwired directly to EVP's
       OBJ_NAME-based storage have been backed out. New cipher/digest support
       has been constructed and will be committed shortly.
     - each implementation defines its own ENGINE_load_<name> function now.
     - the "openssl" ENGINE isn't needed or loaded any more.
     - core (not algorithm or class specific) ENGINE code has been split into
       multiple files to increase readability and decrease linker bloat.
     - ENGINE_cpy() has been removed as it wasn't really a good idea in the
       first place and now, because of registration issues, can't be
       meaningfully defined any more.
     - BN_MOD_EXP[_CRT] support is removed as per the README.
     - a bug in enginetest.c has been fixed.
    
    NB: This commit almost certainly breaks compilation until subsequent
    changes are committed.

    'evp_test' needs to initialise and cleanup EVP_CIPHER_CTX structures. Also,
    fix a typo and add cleanup operations. This also switches on memory leak
    checking (which is how the rest was found).

    ENGINE uses a very opaque design, so we can predeclare the structure type
    in "types.h" so that very few headers will need to include engine.h,
    generally only C files using API functions will need it (reducing
    the header dependencies quite a lot).

    Get rid of hazardous EVP_DigestInit_dbg/EVP_DigestInit case
    distinction (which does not work well because if CRYPTO_MDEBUG is
    defined at library compile time, it is not necessarily defined at
    application compile time; and memory debugging now can be reconfigured
    at run-time anyway).  To get the intended semantics, we could just use
    the EVP_DigestInit_dbg unconditionally (which uses the caller's
    __FILE__ and __LINE__ for memory leak debugging), but this would make
    memory debugging inconsistent.  Instead, callers can use
    CRYPTO_push_info() to track down memory leaks.

    Fix apps/openssl.c and ssl/ssltest.c so that they use
    CRYPTO_set_mem_debug_options() instead of CRYPTO_dbg_set_options(),
    which is the default implementation of the former and should usually
    not be directly used by applications (at least if we assume that the
    options accepted by the default implementation will also be meaningful
    to any other implementations).
    
    Also fix apps/openssl.c and ssl/ssltest such that environment variable
    setting 'OPENSSL_DEBUG_MEMORY=off' actively disables the compiled-in
    library defaults (i.e. such that CRYPTO_MDEBUG is ignored in this
    case).

    ENGINEs can now perform structural cleanup.

commit 1a7691c0594a46015f8695a623c9f8934ab641e2
Author: Geoff Thorpe <geoff@openssl.org>
Date:   Wed Sep 5 19:00:33 2001 +0000

    This adds "destroy" handlers to the existing ENGINEs that load their own
    error strings - the destroy handler functions unload the error strings so
    any pending error state referring to them will not attempt to reference
    them after the ENGINE has been destroyed.

commit f524ddbe049e260763d410cd41fc66bdaf4b01e5
Author: Geoff Thorpe <geoff@openssl.org>
Date:   Wed Sep 5 18:32:23 2001 +0000

    ENGINE's init() and finish() handler functions are used when the ENGINE is
    being enabled or disabled (respectively) for operation. Additionally, each
    ENGINE has a constructor function where it can do more 'structural' level
    intialisations such as loading error strings, creating "ex_data" indices,
    etc. This change introduces a handler function that gives an ENGINE a
    corresponding opportunity to cleanup when the ENGINE is being destroyed. It
    also adds the "get/set" API functions that control this "destroy" handler
    function in an ENGINE.

    Change DH_up() -> DH_up_ref()

    "DH_up" had been changed to "DH_up_ref" in libeay.num but the function
    declaration and implementation had not. So a recent update recreated the
    original definition in libeay.num ... this corrects it and changes the "dh"
    code to the "up_ref" variant.

    (Preprocessor symbols such as _POSIX_C_SOURCE or _XOPEN_SOURCE are

    an outlaw though.)

Author: Geoff Thorpe <geoff@openssl.org>
Date:   Mon Sep 3 21:33:00 2001 +0000

    This changes the existing hardware ENGINE implementations to dynamically
    declare their own error strings so that they can be more easily compiled as
    external shared-libraries if desired. Also, each implementation has been
    given canonical "dynamic" support at the base of each file and is only
    built if the ENGINE_DYNAMIC_SUPPORT symbol is defined.
    
    Also, use "void" prototypes rather than empty prototypes in engine_int.h.
    
    This does not yet;
      (i) remove error strings when unloading,
     (ii) remove the redundant ENGINE_R_*** codes (though ENGINE_F_*** codes
          have gone), or
    (iii) provide any instructions on how to build shared-library ENGINEs or
          use them.
    
    All are on their way.

commit 9391f97715e8fa7494265a1b77923f9b6fb76d8f
Author: Geoff Thorpe <geoff@openssl.org>
Date:   Mon Sep 3 19:15:29 2001 +0000

    This change adds a new ENGINE called "dynamic" that allows new ENGINE
    implementations to be loaded from self-contained shared-libraries. It also
    provides (in engine.h) definitions and macros to help implement a
    self-contained ENGINE. Version control is handled in a way whereby the
    loader or loadee can veto the load depending on any objections it has with
    each other's declared interface level. The way this is currently
    implemented assumes a veto will only take place when one side notices the
    other's interface level is too *old*. If the other side is newer, it should
    be assumed the newer version knows better whether to veto the load or not.
    Version checking (like other "dynamic" settings) can be controlled using
    the "dynamic" ENGINE's control commands. Also, the semantics for the
    loading allow a shared-library ENGINE implementation to handle differing
    interface levels on the fly (eg. loading secondary shared-libraries
    depending on the versions required).
    
    Code will be added soon to the existing ENGINEs to illustrate how they can
    be built as external libraries rather than building statically into
    libcrypto.
    
    NB: Applications wanting to support "dynamic"-loadable ENGINEs will need to
    add support for ENGINE "control commands". See apps/engine.c for an example
    of this, and use "apps/openssl engine -vvvv" to test or experiment.

    Make the necessary changes to work with the recent "ex_data" overhaul.
    See the commit log message for that for more information.
    
    NB: X509_STORE_CTX's use of "ex_data" support was actually misimplemented
    (initialisation by "memset" won't/can't/doesn't work). This fixes that but
    requires that X509_STORE_CTX_init() be able to handle errors - so its
    prototype has been changed to return 'int' rather than 'void'. All uses of
    that function throughout the source code have been tracked down and
    adjusted.

commit 3a0799977bcb154d044828e96a25a01eb478de51
Author: Geoff Thorpe <geoff@openssl.org>
Date:   Sat Sep 1 19:56:46 2001 +0000

    First step in fixing "ex_data" support. Warning: big commit log ...
    
    Currently, this change merely addresses where ex_data indexes are stored
    and managed, and thus fixes the thread-safety issues that existed at that
    level. "Class" code (eg. RSA, DSA, etc) no longer store their own STACKS
    and per-class index counters - all such data is stored inside ex_data.c. So
    rather than passing both STACK+counter to index-management ex_data
    functions, a 'class_index' is instead passed to indicate the class (eg.
    CRYPTO_EX_INDEX_RSA). New classes can be dynamically registered on-the-fly
    and this is also thread-safe inside ex_data.c (though whether the caller
    manages the return value in a thread-safe way is not addressed).
    
    This does not change the "get/set" functions on individual "ex_data"
    structures, and so thread-safety at that level isn't (yet) assured.
    Likewise, the method of getting and storing per-class indexes has not
    changed, so locking may still be required at the "caller" end but is
    nonetheless thread-safe inside "ex_data"'s internal implementation.
    Typically this occurs when code implements a new method of some kind and
    stores its own per-class index in a global variable without locking the
    setting and usage of that variable. If the code in question is likely to be
    used in multiple threads, locking the setting and use of that index is
    still up to the code in question. Possible fixes to this are being
    sketched, but definitely require more major changes to the API itself than
    this change undertakes.
    
    The underlying implementation in ex_data.c has also been modularised so
    that alternative "ex_data" implementations (that control all access to
    state) can be plugged in. Eg. a loaded module can have its implementation
    set to that of the application loaded it - the result being that
    thread-safety and consistency of "ex_data" classes and indexes can be
    maintained in the same place rather than the loaded module using its own
    copy of ex_data support code and state.
    
    Due to the centralisation of "state" with this change, cleanup of all
    "ex_data" state can now be performed properly. Previously all allocation of
    ex_data state was guaranteed to leak - and MemCheck_off() had been used to
    avoid it flagging up the memory debugging. A new function has been added to
    perfrom all this cleanup, CRYPTO_cleanup_all_ex_data(). The "openssl"
    command(s) have been changed to use this cleanup, as have the relevant test
    programs. External application code may want to do so too - failure to
    cleanup will not induce more memory leaking than was the case before, but
    the memory debugging is not tricked into hiding it any more so it may
    "appear" where it previously did not.

    Note the "ERR" changes.

commit 566bdf2bda44f2414ffc20f0540d703f3280749c
Author: Geoff Thorpe <geoff@openssl.org>
Date:   Sat Aug 25 17:51:59 2001 +0000

    This changes the "ERR" code to have all access to state (a hash table of
    error strings and a hash table storing per-thread error state) go via an
    ERR_FNS function table. The first time an ERR operation occurs, the
    implementation that will be used (from then on) is set to the internal
    "defaults" implementation if it has not already been set. The actual LHASH
    tables are only accessed by this implementation.
    
    This is primarily for modules that can be loaded at run-time and bound into
    an application (or a shared-library version of OpenSSL). If the module has
    its own statically-linked copy of OpenSSL code - this mechanism allows it
    to *not* create and use ERR information in its own linked "ERR" code, but
    instead to use and interact with the state stored in the loader
    (application or shared library). The loader calls ERR_get_implementation()
    and the return value is what the module should use when calling its own
    copy of ERR_set_implementation().

    Give DH, DSA, and RSA functions to "up" their reference counts. Otherwise,

    gcc 3.0 tells me that -m486 is deprecated.  The gcc 2.95 manual tells
    me the same and that the correct option is -mcpu=i486.  I'm assuming
    -mcpu has been around for some time, and that it's therefore safe to
    change all occurences of -m486 to -mcpu=i486.

    The indexes returned by ***_get_ex_new_index() functions are used when
    setting stack (actually, array) values in ex_data. So only increment the
    global counters if the underlying CRYPTO_get_ex_new_index() call succeeds.
    This change doesn't make "ex_data" right (see the comment at the head of
    ex_data.c to know why), but at least makes the source code marginally less
    frustrating.

    Apply the Tru64 patch from Tim Mooney <mooney@dogbert.cc.ndsu.NoDak.edu>
    
    His comments are:
    
    1) Changes all references for `True64' to be `Tru64', which is the correct
    spelling for the OS name.
    
    2) Makes `alpha-cc' be the same as `alpha164-cc', and adds an `alphaold-cc'
    entry that is the same as the previous `alpha-cc'.  The reason is that most
    people these days are using the newer compiler, so it should be the default.
    
    3) Adds a bit of commentary to Configure, regarding the name changes of
    the OS over the years, so it's not so confusing to people that haven't been
    with the OS for a while.
    
    4) Adds an `alpha-cc-rpath' target (which is *not* selected automatically
    by Configure under any circumstance) that builds an RPATH into the
    shared libraries.  This is explained in the comment in Configure.  It's
    very very useful for people that want it, and people that don't want it
    just shouldn't choose that target.
    
    5) Adds the `-pthread' flag as the best way to get POSIX thread support
    from the newer compiler.
    
    6) Updates the Makefile targets, so that when the `alpha164-cc', `alpha-cc',
    or `alpha-cc-rpath' target is what Configure is set to use, it uses a Makefile
    target that includes the `-msym' option when building the shared library.
    This is a performance enhancement.
    
    7) Updates `config' so that if it detects you're running version 4 or 5
    of the OS, it automatically selects `alpha-cc', but uses `alphaold-cc'
    for versions 1-3 of the OS.
    
    8) Updates the comment in opensslv.h, fixing both the OS name typo and
    adding a reference to IRIX 6.x, since the shared library semantics are
    virtually identical there.

    More Kerberos SSL changes from Jeffrey Altman <jaltman@columbia.edu>
    His comments are:
    
    First, it corrects a problem introduced in the last patch where the
    kssl_map_enc() would intentionally return NULL for valid ENCTYPE
    values.  This was done to prevent verification of the kerberos 5
    authenticator from being performed when Derived Key ciphers were
    in use.  Unfortunately, the authenticator verification routine was
    not the only place that function was used.  And it caused core dumps.
    
    Second, it attempt to add to SSL_SESSION the Kerberos 5 Client
    Principal Name.

    I know these two should be separate, and I'll back out the DES changes if they

    Enhanced support for IA-64 Linux and HP-UX (as well as better support for
    HP-UX in common in ./config). Note that for the moment of this writing
    none of 64-bit platforms pass bntest. I'm committing this anyway as it's
    too frustrating to patch snapshots over and over while 0.9.6 is known to
    work.

    More linker bloat reorganisation:
    
    Split private key PEM and normal PEM handling. Private key
    handling needs to link in stuff like PKCS#8.
    
    Relocate the ASN1 *_dup() functions, to the relevant ASN1
    modules using new macro IMPLEMENT_ASN1_DUP_FUNCTION. Previously
    these were all in crypto/x509/x_all.c along with every ASN1
    BIO/fp function which linked in *every* ASN1 function if
    a single dup was used.
    
    Move the authority key id ASN1 structure to a separate file.
    This is used in the X509 routines and its previous location
    linked in all the v3 extension code.
    
    Also move ASN1_tag2bit to avoid linking in a_bytes.c which
    is now largely obsolete.
    
    So far under Linux stripped binary with single PEM_read_X509
    is now 238K compared to 380K before these changes.

    First of several reorganisations to
    reduce linker bloat. For example the
    single line:
    
    PEM_read_X509()
    
    results in a binary of around 400K in Linux!
    
    This first step separates some of the PEM functions and
    avoids linking in some PKCS#7 and PKCS#12 code.

    - New INSTALL document describing different ways to build "tunala" and
      possible problems.
    - New file breakage.c handles (so far) missing functions.
    - Get rid of some signed/unsigned/const warnings thanks to solaris-cc
    - Add autoconf/automake input files, and helper scripts to populate missing
      (but auto-generated) files.
    
    This change adds a configure.in and Makefile.am to build everything using
    autoconf, automake, and libtool - and adds "gunk" scripts to generate the
    various files those things need (and clean then up again after). This means
    that "autogunk.sh" needs to be run first on a system with the autotools,
    but the resulting directory should be "configure"able and compilable on
    systems without those tools.

    More Kerberos SSL patches from Vern Staats <staatsvr@asc.hpc.mil>.
    His comments are:
    
    This patch fixes the problem of modern Kerberos using "derived keys"
    to encrypt the authenticator by disabling the authenticator check
    for all derived keys enctypes.
    
    I think I've got all the bugfixes that Jeffrey and I discussed rolled
    into this.  There were some problems with Jeffrey's code to convert
    the authenticator's Kerberos timestring into struct tm (e.g. Z, -1900;
    it helps to have an actual decryptable authenticator to play with).
    So I've shamelessly pushed in my code, while stealing some bits from
    Jeffrey.

commit 81d1998e096684d8ca4318ffdfc07495a8c906de
Author: Geoff Thorpe <geoff@openssl.org>
Date:   Fri Jul 20 15:16:10 2001 +0000

    Currently, RSA code, when using no padding scheme, simply checks that input
    does not contain more bytes than the RSA modulus 'n' - it does not check
    that the input is strictly *less* than 'n'. Whether this should be the
    case or not is open to debate - however, due to security problems with
    returning miscalculated CRT results, the 'rsa_mod_exp' implementation in
    rsa_eay.c now performs a public-key exponentiation to verify the CRT result
    and in the event of an error will instead recalculate and return a non-CRT
    (more expensive) mod_exp calculation. As the mod_exp of 'I' is equivalent
    to the mod_exp of 'I mod n', and the verify result is automatically between
    0 and n-1 inclusive, the verify only matches the input if 'I' was less than
    'n', otherwise even a correct CRT calculation is only congruent to 'I' (ie.
    they differ by a multiple of 'n'). Rather than rejecting correct
    calculations and doing redundant and slower ones instead, this changes the
    equality check in the verification code to a congruence check.

    openssl speed is quite useful for testing hardware support (among other
    things), especially as the RSA keys are fixed. However, DSA only fixes the
    DSA parameters and then generates the public and private components on the
    fly each time - this commit hard-codes some sampled key values so that this
    is no longer the case.

    Changes to the Kerberos SSL code by Jeffrey Altman <jaltman@columbia.edu>
    His comments are:
    
     . Fixed all of the Windows dynamic loading functions, prototypes, etc.
    
     . Corrected all of the unsigned/signed comparison warnings
    
     . Replaced the references to krb5_cksumarray[] for two reasons.
       First, it was an internal variable that should not have been
       referenced outside the library; nor could it have been with
       a shared library with restricted exports.  Second, the
       variable is no longer used in current Kerberos implementations.
       I replaced the code with equivalent functionality using functions
       that are exported from the library.

    For consistency with the terminology used in my SAC2001 paper, avoid
    the term "simultaneous multiplication" (which -- acording to the
    paper, at least -- applies only to certain methods which we don't use
    here)

    Patches from Vern Staats <staatsvr@asc.hpc.mil> to get Kerberos 5 in
    SSL according to RFC 2712.  His comment is:
    
    This is a patch to openssl-SNAP-20010702 to support Kerberized SSL
    authentication.  I'm expecting to have the full kssl-0.5 kit up on
    sourceforge by the end of the week.  The full kit includes patches
    for mod-ssl, apache, and a few text clients.  The sourceforge URL
    is http://sourceforge.net/projects/kssl/ .
    
    Thanks to a note from Simon Wilkinson I've replaced my KRB5 AP_REQ
    message with a real KerberosWrapper struct.  I think this is fully
    RFC 2712 compliant now, including support for the optional
    authenticator field.  I also added openssl-style ASN.1 macros for
    a few Kerberos structs; see crypto/krb5/ if you're interested.

    A better compromise between encrypt and decrypt (but why isn't it as fast
    for encrypt?).

    Handle the common case first (where input size is a multiple of block size).
    Worth around 5% for encrypt. Slows down decrypt slightly, but I expect to
    regain that later.

Date:   Sat Jun 23 16:25:56 2001 +0000

    Do not loop i the OpenSSL UI method any more.  Instead, letthe
    application do that.
    
    NOTE: there's no requirement for other UI_METHODs to avoid this kind
    of loop.  For example, a GUI UI_METHOD would probably check the
    lengths of the answers from within instead of being constantly
    redisplayed for everything that is wrong.

Date:   Sat Jun 23 16:22:48 2001 +0000

    Implement boolean (yes/no or OK/Cancel, ...) input.
    
    Implement UI controls.  Current controls are the possibility to output
    the OpenSSL error stack on the same channel from within UI_process()
    and to check if the same user interface can be redone without being
    rebuilt (this is often more a question of philosophy than
    technicalities).

    For the UI functions that return an int, 0 or any positive number is a
    success return, any negative number is a failure.  Make sure we check
    the return value with that in mind.

    Change all calls to low level digest routines in the library and
    applications to use EVP. Add missing calls to HMAC_cleanup() and
    don't assume HMAC_CTX can be copied using memcpy().
    
    Note: this is almost identical to the patch submitted to openssl-dev
    by Verdon Walker <VWalker@novell.com> except some redundant
    EVP_add_digest_()/EVP_cleanup() calls were removed and some changes
    made to avoid compiler warnings.

    Change the common application routines to use a UI_METHOD for password
    prompting, even when done through the callback.

Date:   Tue Jun 19 16:12:18 2001 +0000

    - Add the possibility to control engines through control names but
      with arbitrary arguments instead of just a string.
    - Change the key loaders to take a UI_METHOD instead of a callback
      function pointer.  NOTE: this breaks binary compatibility with
      earlier versions of OpenSSL [engine].
    - Addapt the nCipher code for these new conditions and add a card
      insertion callback.

Author: Bodo Möller <bodo@openssl.org>
Date:   Mon Jun 11 09:54:28 2001 +0000

    Earlier OpenSSL versions printed prompts to stderr.
    In the new crypto/ui/, this was changed into tty (which is usually
    /dev/tty), i.e. the FILE * used for reading passwords from the user.
    However stdio buffering for read/write streams is not without pitfalls
    (passwords would be echoed on some systems).
    To avoid problems, split tty into tty_in and tty_out (which are
    opened separately).

    A good use of the UI interface is as a password callback replacement
    (for new functions...).  One might still want to be able to pass down
    a user-data pointer to be used by the UI.  However, ex_data doesn't
    quite cut it, since that means the appropriate index to it might need
    to be shared between parts that aren't really related in that sense,
    and would require the currently hidden (static) index holders to be
    uncovered.  Not a good thing.  Therefore, add the possibility to add a
    user-data pointer to a UI.

    Extend all the loading functions to take an engine pointer, a pass
    string (some engines may have certificates protected by a PIN!) and
    a description to put into error messages.
    
    Also, have our own password callback that we can send both a password
    and some prompt info to.  The default password callback in EVP assumes
    that the passed parameter is a password, which isn't always the right
    thing, and the ENGINE code (at least the nCipher one) makes other
    assumptions...
    
    Also, in spite of having the functions to load keys, some utilities
    did the loading all by themselves...  That's changed too.

    We had the password callback for ENGINEs pretty much wrong.  And
    passwords that were given to the key loading functions were completely
    ignored, at least in the ncipher code, and then we made the assumption
    that the callback wanted a prompt as user argument.
    
    All that is now changed, and the application author is forced to give
    a callback function of type pem_callback_cb and possibly an argument
    for it, just as for all other functions that want to generate password
    prompting.
    
    NOTE: this change creates binary and source incompatibilities with
    previous versions of OpenSSL [engine].  It's worth it this time, to
    get it right (or at least better and with a chance that it'll work).

    Under VC++ _DLL is set to indicate that the application
    will be linked against the DLL runtime library. It is
    automatically set when /MD is used.
    
    As a result OpenSSL shouldn't use _DLL to determine if
    it should set OPENSSL_OPT_WINDLL because this will
    cause linkage conflicts with static builds which do
    include the /MD compiler switch.

    Some platforms (most notably Windows) do not have a $HOME by default.
    For those, unless the environment variables RANDFILE or HOME are
    defined (the default case!), RAND_file_name() will return NULL.
    This change adds a default HOME for those platforms.
    
    To add a default HOME for any platform, just define DEFAULT_HOME in
    the proper place, wrapped in appropriate #ifdef..#endif, in e_os.h.

Author: Geoff Thorpe <geoff@openssl.org>
Date:   Thu Apr 26 23:04:30 2001 +0000

    Some fixes to the reference-counting in ENGINE code. First, there were a
    few statements equivalent to "ENGINE_add(ENGINE_openssl())" etc. The inner
    call to ENGINE_openssl() (as with other functions like it) orphans a
    structural reference count. Second, the ENGINE_cleanup() function also
    needs to clean up the functional reference counts held internally as the
    list of "defaults" (ie. as used when RSA_new() requires an appropriate
    ENGINE reference). So ENGINE_clear_defaults() was created and is called
    from within ENGINE_cleanup(). Third, some of the existing code was
    logically broken in its treatment of reference counts and locking (my
    fault), so the necessary bits have been restructured and tidied up.
    
    To test this stuff, compiling with ENGINE_REF_COUNT_DEBUG will cause every
    reference count change (both structural and functional) to log a message to
    'stderr'. Using with "openssl engine" for example shows this in action
    quite well as the 'engine' sub-command cleans up after itself properly.
    
    Also replaced some spaces with tabs.

commit 0ce5f3e4f5ec8ca806e92fa79c06e670239662fa
Author: Geoff Thorpe <geoff@openssl.org>
Date:   Thu Apr 26 19:35:44 2001 +0000

    This adds 2 things to the ENGINE code.
    
     * "ex_data" - a CRYPTO_EX_DATA structure in the ENGINE structure itself
       that allows an ENGINE to store its own information there rather than in
       global variables. It follows the declarations and implementations used
       in RSA code, for better or worse. However there's a problem when storing
       state with ENGINEs because, unlike related structure types in OpenSSL,
       there is no ENGINE-vs-ENGINE_METHOD separation. Because of what ENGINE
       is, it has method pointers as its structure elements ...  which leads
       to;
    
     * ENGINE_FLAGS_BY_ID_COPY - if an ENGINE should not be used just as a
       reference to an "implementation" (eg. to get to a hardware device), but
       should also be able to maintain state, then this flag can be set by the
       ENGINE implementation. The result is that any call to ENGINE_by_id()
       will not result in the existing ENGINE being returned (with its
       structural reference count incremented) but instead a new copy of the
       ENGINE will be returned that can maintain its own state independantly of
       any other copies returned in the past or future. Eg. key-generation
       might involve a series of ENGINE-specific control commands to set
       algorithms, sizes, module-keys, ids, ACLs, etc. A final command could
       generate the key. An ENGINE doing this would *have* to declare
       ENGINE_FLAGS_BY_ID_COPY so that the state of that process can be
       maintained "per-handle" and unaffected by other code having a reference
       to the same ENGINE structure.

commit f11bc840805a9ca0f18b6a6e8bf5c7bb03228e90
Author: Geoff Thorpe <geoff@openssl.org>
Date:   Thu Apr 19 02:08:26 2001 +0000

    Changes to "openssl engine" to support the new control command code in
    ENGINE.
    
     * Extra verbosity can be added with more "v"'s, eg. '-vvv' gives
       information about input flags and descriptions for each control command
       in each ENGINE. Check the output of "openssl engine -vvv" for example.
    
     * '-pre <cmd>' and '-post <cmd>' can be used to invoke control commands on
       the specified ENGINE (or on all of them if no engine id is specified,
       although that usually gets pretty ugly). '-post' commands are only
       attempted if '-t' is specified and the engine successfully initialises.
       '-pre' commands are always attempted whether or not '-t' causes an
       initialisation to be tried afterwards. Multiple '-pre' and/or '-post'
       commands can be specified and they will be called in the order they
       occur on the command line.
    
    Parameterised commands (the normal case, there are currently no
    unparameterised ones) are split into command and argument via a separating
    colon. Eg. "openssl engine -pre SO_PATH:/lib/libdriver.so <id>" results in
    the call;
        ENGINE_ctrl_cmd_string(e, "SO_PATH", "/lib/libdriver.so", 0);
    
    Application code should similarly allow arbitrary name-value string pairs
    to be passed into ENGINEs in a manner matching that in apps/engine.c,
    either using the same colon-separated format, or entered as two distinct
    strings. Eg. as stored in a registry. The last parameter of
    ENGINE_ctrl_cmd_string can be changed from 0 to 1 if the command should
    only be attempted if it's supported by the specified ENGINE (eg. for
    commands like "FORK_CHECK:1" that may or may not apply to the run-time
    ENGINE).

Author: Geoff Thorpe <geoff@openssl.org>
Date:   Thu Apr 19 01:45:40 2001 +0000

    Some more tweaks to ENGINE code.
    
    This change adds some basic control commands to the existing ENGINEs
    (except the software 'openssl' engine). All these engines currently load
    shared-libraries for hardware APIs, so they've all been given "SO_PATH"
    commands that will configure the chosen ENGINE to load its shared library
    from the given path. Eg. by calling;
        ENGINE_ctrl_cmd_string(e, "SO_PATH", <path>, 0).
    
    The nCipher 'chil' ENGINE has also had "FORK_CHECK" and "THREAD_LOCKING"
    commands added so these settings could be handled via application-level
    configuration rather than in application source code.
    
    Changes to "openssl engine" to test and examine these control commands will
    be made shortly. It will also provide the necessary tips to application
    programs wanting to support these dynamic control commands.

commit 40fcda292f990a25d0ef52d2761be0f20d653e93
Author: Geoff Thorpe <geoff@openssl.org>
Date:   Thu Apr 19 00:41:55 2001 +0000

    Some BIG tweaks to ENGINE code.
    
    This change adds some new functionality to the ENGINE code and API to
    make it possible for ENGINEs to describe and implement their own control
    commands that can be interrogated and used by calling applications at
    run-time. The source code includes numerous comments explaining how it all
    works and some of the finer details. But basically, an ENGINE will normally
    declare an array of ENGINE_CMD_DEFN entries in its ENGINE - and the various
    new ENGINE_CTRL_*** command types take care of iterating through this list
    of definitions, converting command numbers to names, command names to
    numbers, getting descriptions, getting input flags, etc. These
    administrative commands are handled directly in the base ENGINE code rather
    than in each ENGINE's ctrl() handler, unless they specify the
    ENGINE_FLAGS_MANUAL_CMD_CTRL flag (ie. if they're doing something clever or
    dynamic with the command definitions).
    
    There is also a new function, ENGINE_cmd_is_executable(), that will
    determine if an ENGINE control command is of an "executable" type that
    can be used in another new function, ENGINE_ctrl_cmd_string(). If not, the
    control command is not supposed to be exposed out to user/config level
    access - eg. it could involve the exchange of binary data, returning
    results to calling code, etc etc. If the command is executable then
    ENGINE_ctrl_cmd_string() can be called using a name/arg string pair. The
    control command's input flags will be used to determine necessary
    conversions before the control command is called, and commands of this
    form will always return zero or one (failure or success, respectively).
    This is set up so that arbitrary applications can support control commands
    in a consistent way so that tweaking particular ENGINE behaviour is
    specific to the ENGINE and the host environment, and independant of the
    application or OpenSSL.
    
    Some code demonstrating this stuff in action will applied shortly to the
    various ENGINE implementations, as well as "openssl engine" support for
    executing arbitrary control commands before and/or after initialising
    various ENGINEs.

commit 59bc3126c5434970844b37c042852ec7aadc2a53
Author: Geoff Thorpe <geoff@openssl.org>
Date:   Wed Apr 18 21:46:00 2001 +0000

    Some more tweaks to ENGINE code.
    
    The existing ENGINEs (including the default 'openssl' software engine) were
    static, declared inside the source file for each engine implementation. The
    reason this was not going boom was that all the ENGINEs had reference
    counts that never hit zero (once linked into the internal list, each would
    always have at least 1 lasting structural reference).
    
    To fix this so it will stay standing when an "unload" function is added to
    match ENGINE_load_builtin_engines(), the "constructor" functions for each
    ENGINE implementation have been changed to dynamically allocate and
    construct their own ENGINEs using API functions. The other benefit of this
    is that no ENGINE implementation has to include the internal "engine_int.h"
    header file any more.

    Some more tweaks from ENGINE code.
    
    Previously RAND_get_rand_method was returning a non-const pointer, but it
    should be const. As with all other such cases, METHOD pointers are stored and
    returned as "const". The only methods one should be able to alter are methods
    "local" to the relevant code, in which case a non-const handle to the methods
    should already exist.
    
    This change has been forced by the constifying of the ENGINE code (before
    which RAND_METHOD was the only method pointer in an ENGINE structure that was
    not constant).

Author: Geoff Thorpe <geoff@openssl.org>
Date:   Wed Apr 18 03:57:05 2001 +0000

    Some more tweaks to ENGINE code.
    
    ENGINE handler functions should take the ENGINE structure as a parameter -
    this is because ENGINE structures can be copied, and like other
    structure/method setups in OpenSSL, it should be possible for init(),
    finish(), ctrl(), etc to adjust state inside the ENGINE structures rather
    than globally. This commit includes the dependant changes in the ENGINE
    implementations.

Author: Geoff Thorpe <geoff@openssl.org>
Date:   Wed Apr 18 03:03:16 2001 +0000

    Some more tweaks to ENGINE code.
    
    Previous changes permanently removed the commented-out old code for where
    it was possible to create and use an ENGINE statically, and this code gets
    rid of the ENGINE_FLAGS_MALLOCED flag that supported the distinction with
    dynamically allocated ENGINEs. It also moves the area for ENGINE_FLAGS_***
    values from engine_int.h to engine.h - because it should be possible to
    declare ENGINEs just from declarations in exported headers.

Author: Geoff Thorpe <geoff@openssl.org>
Date:   Wed Apr 18 02:01:36 2001 +0000

    Some more tweaks to ENGINE code.
    
    * Constify the get/set functions, and add some that functions were missing.
    
    * Add a new 'ENGINE_cpy()' function that will produce a new ENGINE based
      copied from an original (except for the references, ie. the new copy will
      be like an ENGINE returned from 'ENGINE_new()' - a structural reference).
    
    * Removed the "null parameter" checking in the get/set functions - it is
      legitimate to set NULL values as a way of *changing* an ENGINE (ie.
      removing a handler that previously existed). Also, passing a NULL pointer
      for an ENGINE is obviously wrong for these functions, so don't bother
      checking for it. The result is a number of error codes and strings could
      be removed.

    ENGINE_load_[private|public]_key had error handling that could return

    Since there has been reports of clashes between OpenSSL's
    des_encrypt() and des_encrypt() defined on some systems (Solaris and
    Unixware and maybe others), we rename des_encrypt() to des_encrypt1().
    This should have very little impact on external software unless
    someone has written a mode of DES, since that's all des_encrypt() is
    meant for.

    For mips3 and alpha, put the assembler file directives in separate
    variables and disable the Alpha assembler for now, since it has been
    shown to fail.
    
    The Alpha failure can be shown by adding the following numbers:

    FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF46FFE0FFFF0000

    gcc uses collect2, not ld, to link things.  Therefore, when using gcc
    there's no need fooling ourselves, it's the gnu-shared method that we
    should use.  Do it for Solaris to begin with.

    Use 32bit longs on Alpha as well, because that's what the VMS
    assembler code works with.
    
    Of course, the assembler code could differ between platforms.  That

    Instead of telling both 'make' and the user that ranlib
    errors can be tolerated, hide the error from 'make'.
    This gives shorter output both if ranlib fails and if

    Introduce the possibility to access global variables through
    functions on platform were that's the best way to handle exporting
    global variables in shared libraries.  To enable this functionality,
    one must configure with "EXPORT_VAR_AS_FN" or defined the C macro
    "OPENSSL_EXPORT_VAR_AS_FUNCTION" in crypto/opensslconf.h (the latter
    is normally done by Configure or something similar).
    
    To implement a global variable, use the macro OPENSSL_IMPLEMENT_GLOBAL
    in the source file (foo.c) like this:
    
    	OPENSSL_IMPLEMENT_GLOBAL(int,foo)=1;
    	OPENSSL_IMPLEMENT_GLOBAL(double,bar);
    
    To declare a global variable, use the macros OPENSSL_DECLARE_GLOBAL
    and OPENSSL_GLOBAL_REF in the header file (foo.h) like this:
    
    	OPENSSL_DECLARE_GLOBAL(int,foo);
    	#define foo OPENSSL_GLOBAL_REF(foo)
    	OPENSSL_DECLARE_GLOBAL(double,bar);
    	#define bar OPENSSL_GLOBAL_REF(bar)
    
    The #defines are very important, and therefore so is including the
    header file everywere where the defined globals are used.
    
    The macro OPENSSL_EXPORT_VAR_AS_FUNCTION also affects the definition
    of ASN.1 items, but that structure is a bt different.
    
    The largest change is in util/mkdef.pl which has been enhanced with
    better and easier to understand logic to choose which symbols should
    go into the Windows .def files as well as a number of fixes and code
    cleanup (among others, algorithm keywords are now sorted
    lexicographically to avoid constant rewrites).

Date:   Fri Feb 23 00:02:56 2001 +0000

    Fix an oversight - when checking a potential session ID for conflicts with
    an SSL_CTX's session cache, it is necessary to compare the ssl_version at
    the same time (a conflict is defined, courtesy of SSL_SESSION_cmp(), as a
    matching id/id_length pair and a matching ssl_version). However, the
    SSL_SESSION that will result from the current negotiation does not
    necessarily have the same ssl version as the "SSL_METHOD" in use by the
    SSL_CTX - part of the work in a handshake is to agree on an ssl version!
    
    This is fixed by having the check function accept an SSL pointer rather
    than the SSL_CTX it belongs to.

    CONF_METHOD is one of the few places where you find MS_FAR.  I can't
    really see why we need to define these function pointers with MS_FAR
    if it's not done cosistently everywhere.
    
    If we decide to support MS_FAR modifiers, it's better to have the
    named something more unique for OpenSSL and to define them in e_os2.h.

    make strcasecmp a macro to _stricmp.

    Always include opensslconf.h, even if it's already been done before.
    The reason is that some parts are only included when certain other
    include files have been included.
    
    Also, it seems that the rest of the OpenSSL code assumes that all
    kinds of M$ Windows are MSDOS as well...

Author: Geoff Thorpe <geoff@openssl.org>

    If a callback is generating a new session ID for SSLv2, then upon exiting,
    the ID will be padded out to 16 bytes if the callback attempted to generate
    a shorter one. The problem is that the uniqueness checking function used in
    callbacks may mistakenly think a 9-byte ID is unique when in fact its
    padded 16-byte version is not. This makes the checking function detect
    SSLv2 cases, and ensures the padded form is checked rather than the shorter
    one passed by the callback.

commit 1aa0d9478159b8be4249fc96f575afe8b84e2fa9
Author: Geoff Thorpe <geoff@openssl.org>
Date:   Wed Feb 21 18:38:48 2001 +0000

    This adds command-line support to s_server for controlling the generation
    of session IDs. Namely, passing "-id_prefix <text>" will set a
    generate_session_id() callback that generates session IDs as random data
    with <text> block-copied over the top of the start of the ID. This can be
    viewed by watching the session ID s_client's output when it connects.
    
    This is mostly useful for testing any SSL/TLS code (eg. proxies) that wish
    to deal with multiple servers, when each of which might be generating a
    unique range of session IDs (eg. with a certain prefix).

commit dc644fe2292a9a7ac674a57d2a4be99d7daeab12
Author: Geoff Thorpe <geoff@openssl.org>
Date:   Wed Feb 21 18:06:26 2001 +0000

    This change allows a callback to be used to override the generation of
    SSL/TLS session IDs in a server. According to RFC2246, the session ID is an
    arbitrary value chosen by the server. It can be useful to have some control
    over this "arbitrary value" so as to choose it in ways that can aid in
    things like external session caching and balancing (eg. clustering). The
    default session ID generation is to fill the ID with random data.
    
    The callback used by default is built in to ssl_sess.c, but registering a
    callback in an SSL_CTX or in a particular SSL overrides this. BTW: SSL
    callbacks will override SSL_CTX callbacks, and a new SSL structure inherits
    any callback set in its 'parent' SSL_CTX. The header comments describe how
    this mechanism ticks, and source code comments describe (hopefully) why it
    ticks the way it does.
    
    Man pages are on the way ...
    
    [NB: Lutz was also hacking away and helping me to figure out how best to do
    this.]

    With later version of DEC C on VMS, some functions (strcmp(), for
    example) are declared with some extra linkage information.  This
    generates a warning when using the function name as a value to a
    regular function pointer with the "correct" definition of the
    function.  Therefore, use a macro to cast the appropriate function on
    VMS.

    The callbacks in the NAME_FUNCS structure are not used directly as LHASH
    callbacks, and their prototypes were consistent as they were. These casts
    need reversing.
    
    Also, I personally find line breaks during parameter lists (ie a line
    ending in a comma) easier to read at a glance than line breaks at the end
    of a function call and before a dereference on the return value (ie a line
    ending in a closed-bracket followed by a line starting with "->").

commit 282d8b1c385aad08969a307950350574c66a3ec2
Author: Geoff Thorpe <geoff@openssl.org>
Date:   Mon Feb 12 02:28:29 2001 +0000

    This change was a quick experiment that I'd wanted to try that works quite
    well (and is a good demonstration of how encapsulating the SSL in a
    memory-based state machine can make it easier to apply to different
    situations).
    
    The change implements a new command-line switch "-flipped <0|1>" which, if
    set to 1, reverses the usual interpretation of a client and server for SSL
    tunneling. Normally, an ssl client (ie. "-server 0") accepts "cleartext"
    connections and conducts SSL/TLS over a proxied connection acting as an SSL
    client. Likewise, an ssl server (ie. "-server 1") accepts connections and
    conducts SSL/TLS (as an SSL server) over them and passes "cleartext" over
    the proxied connection. With "-flipped 1", an SSL client (specified with
    "-server 0") in fact accepts SSL connections and proxies clear, whereas an
    SSL server ("-server 1") accepts clear and proxies SSL. NB: most of this
    diff is command-line handling, the actual meat of the change is simply the
    line or two that plugs "clean" and "dirty" file descriptors into the item
    that holds the state-machine - reverse them and you get the desired
    behaviour.
    
    This allows a network server to be an SSL client, and a network client to
    be an SSL server. Apart from curiosity value, there's a couple of possibly
    interesting applications - SSL/TLS is inherently vulnerable to trivial DoS
    attacks, because the SSL server usually has to perform a private key
    operation first, even if the client is authenticated. With this scenario,
    the network client is the SSL server and performs the first private key
    operation, whereas the network server serves as the SSL client. Another
    possible application is when client-only authentication is required (ie.
    the underlying protocol handles (or doesn't care about) authenticating the
    server). Eg. an SSL/TLS version of 'ssh' could be concocted where the
    client's signed certificate is used to validate login to a server system -
    whether or not the client needs to validate who the server is can be
    configured at the client end rather than at the server end (ie. a complete
    inversion of what happens in normal SSL/TLS).
    
    NB: This is just an experiment/play-thing, using "-flipped 1" probably
    creates something that is interoperable with exactly nothing. :-)

    Integrate my implementation of a countermeasure against
    Bleichenbacher's DSA attack.  With this implementation, the expected
    number of iterations never exceeds 2.
    
    New semantics for BN_rand_range():
    BN_rand_range(r, min, range) now generates r such that
         min <= r < min+range.
    (Previously, BN_rand_range(r, min, max) generated r such that
         min <= r < max.
    It is more convenient to have the range; also the previous
    prototype was misleading because max was larger than
    the actual maximum.)

    Update the LHASH man page.
    
    * Correct some prototypes and macros with respect to "const"ness.
    
    * Add the extra macros and examples due to the lh_doall[_arg] modifications
      made recently. The existing example is also reworked for consistency.
    
    * Rewrite, tweak, and supplement bits of the existing comments that seemed
      (IMHO) to be a little convoluted and misleading.
    
    * Add a NOTE section that explains the use of macros and avoiding function
      casts (ie. generate a wrapper as with the macros, or prototype any
      callback functions exactly to not require casting). Also, explain the
      "const" approach taken in LHASH for the purposes of API comprehensibility
      and also application code auditing.

    - a couple of illegal includes of <openssl/e_os.h> should be purged
    - ex_data sucks

    Last time I asked, no-one appeared to remember if these "NEEDS PATCH"
    entries are still current or what they are about:
    
        o  non-blocking socket on AIX
        o  $(PERL) in */Makefile.ssl
    
    So I'll remove them for now.

    Change prototypes for new CRYPTO_..._mem_ex_functions functions so
    that they match the function definitions (namely, remove file/line
    parameters from free_func).

commit 65a22e8e4dd1763a195b5c4ff8ff2574a13b3240
Author: Richard Levitte <levitte@openssl.org>
Date:   Wed Jan 10 13:14:58 2001 +0000

    As response to a user request to be able to use external memory
    handling routines that need file name and line number information,
    I've added a call level to our memory handling routines to allow that
    kind of hooking.

    Fix uni2asc() so it can properly convert zero length
    unicode strings. Certain PKCS#12 files contain these
    in BMPStrings and it used to crash on them.

    oops, void functions shouldn't try and return a value. Strangely, gcc
    didn't even give a warning for this yet HPUX cc considered it an error.

commit 599c03530ae1b63df396d35b9227d239d451e8fd
Author: Lutz Jänicke <jaenicke@openssl.org>
Date:   Tue Jan 9 16:44:59 2001 +0000

    Add automatic query of EGD sockets to RAND_poll(). The EGD sockets are
    only queried when the /dev/[u]random devices did not return enough
    entropy. Only the amount of entropy missing to reach the required minimum
    is queried, as EGD may be drained.
    Queried locations are: /etc/entropy, /var/run/egd-pool

    It was correctly pointed out to me that my CHANGES entry was a little thin
    on details. :-)

commit 28e5428d5df083c6015be5abc88959ee2e662eb6
Author: Lutz Jänicke <jaenicke@openssl.org>
Date:   Tue Jan 9 10:58:36 2001 +0000

    Don't cheat: when only getting several bytes from each source, n is incremented
    correctly, but RAND_add(..,n) counts the increasing n several times.
    Only RAND_add(..,n) once entropy collection is finished.

commit 3c914840520161d9ca121d38973a79b050916a8a
Author: Geoff Thorpe <geoff@openssl.org>
Date:   Tue Jan 9 00:24:38 2001 +0000

    Move all the existing function pointer casts associated with LHASH's two
    "doall" functions to using type-safe wrappers. As and where required, this
    can be replaced by redeclaring the underlying callbacks to use the
    underlying "void"-based prototypes (eg. if performance suffers from an
    extra level of function invocation).

commit 98d517c5dad7812f2df30f001356eb4cfa7fa6fc
Author: Geoff Thorpe <geoff@openssl.org>
Date:   Tue Jan 9 00:13:25 2001 +0000

    Get rid of the function pointer casting in the debugging memory code due
    to LHASH usage. NB: The callback type used as been suctioned off into
    crypto.h as CRYPTO_MEM_LEAK_CB to improve clarity.

commit 18602745de52e5869f3865245c3c72986831dae2
Author: Geoff Thorpe <geoff@openssl.org>
Date:   Tue Jan 9 00:02:09 2001 +0000

    This adds macros to implement (and/or declare) type-safe wrapper functions
    around the callbacks required in the LHASH code for the "doall" functions.
    
    Also - fix the evil function pointer casting in the two lh_doall functions
    by deferring to a static utility function. Previously lh_doall() was
    invoking lh_doall_arg() by casting the callback to the 2-parameter
    prototype and passing in a NULL argument. This appears to have been working
    thus far but it's not a hot idea. If the extra level of indirection becomes
    a performance hit, we can just provide two virtually identical
    implementations for each variant later on.

commit ad2e032049d8e9460372e273eddb192c300b46dc
Author: Geoff Thorpe <geoff@openssl.org>
Date:   Mon Jan 8 22:03:27 2001 +0000

    Whilst in the process of fixing outstanding function-pointer casts in the
    LHASH code, this evil was uncovered. The cast was obscuring the fact that
    the function was prototyped to take 2 parameters when in fact it is being
    used as a callback that should take only one. Anyway, the function itself
    ignores the second parameter (thankfully). A proper cure is on the way but
    for now this corrects the inconsistency.

    Because /dev/urandom has a better chance of giving us a good and
    quick answer, take that one first.

    Add prototypes for new OCSP functions.
    
    Fix bug in OCSP_find_status().

commit 0c61e299b35a0789d5de7c1972b15a82dff2f122
Author: Richard Levitte <levitte@openssl.org>
Date:   Mon Jan 8 10:59:26 2001 +0000

    Change RAND_poll for Unix to try a number of devices and only read
    them for a short period of time (actually, poll them with select(),
    then read() whatever is there), which is about 10ms (hard-coded value)
    each.
    
    Separate Windows and Unixly code, and start on a VMS variant that
    currently just returns 0.

    Add set of OCSP client functions. All experimental
    and subject to addition, modifcation or deletion.
    
    Add two OCSP nonce utility functions.
    
    Fix typo in status code name.

Author: Dr. Stephen Henson <steve@openssl.org>
Date:   Thu Jan 4 19:53:48 2001 +0000

    Fix typo in OCSP nonce extension.
    
    Set correct type in ASN1_STRING for
    INTEGER and ENUMERATED types.
    
    Make ASN1_INTEGER_get() and ASN1_ENUMERATED_get()
    return -1 for invalid type rather than 0 (which is
    often valid). -1 may also be valid but this is less
    likely.
    
    Load OCSP error strings in ERR_load_crypto_strings().

Author: Dr. Stephen Henson <steve@openssl.org>
Date:   Thu Jan 4 01:46:36 2001 +0000

    Update OCSP API.
    
    Remove extensions argument from various functions
    because it is not needed with the new extension
    code.
    
    New function OCSP_cert_to_id() to convert a pair
    of certificates into an OCSP_CERTID.
    
    New simple OCSP HTTP function. This is rather primitive
    but just about adequate to send OCSP requests and
    parse the response.
    
    Fix typo in CRL distribution points extension.
    
    Fix ASN1 code so it adds a final null to constructed
    strings.

    Look for no-krb5 and add the definition of NO_KRB5 if it's there.
    I've no idea were the KRB5 header files and libraries are placed on
    Win32.  When there's better knowledge, we might be able to process the
    other KRB5-related arguments as well...

Date:   Sun Dec 31 01:41:01 2000 +0000

    Temporary measure: if no KRB5 is defined, add "no-krb5" to the
    options.  This is so mk1mf.pl can pick it up from Makefile.

    Since asn1.h gets included recursively from many places, the easiest
    is to have asn1.h include e_os.h and e_os2.h.  Of course, this makes
    the unofficial "non-export" status of e_os.h a bit delicate...

    Rewrite PKCS#12 code and remove some of the old
    horrible macros.
    
    Fix two evil ASN1 bugs. Attempt to use 'ctx' when
    NULL if input is indefinite length constructed
    in asn1_check_tlen() and invalid pointer to ASN1_TYPE
    when reusing existing structure (this took *ages* to
    find because the new PKCS#12 code triggered it).

    If OPENSSL_BUILD_SHLIBCRYPTO (for files that end up as libcrypto
    objects) or OPENSSL_BUILD_SHLIBSSL (for files that end up as libssl
    objects) is defined, redefine OPENSSL_EXTERN to be OPENSSL_EXPORT.
    This is actually only important on Win32, and can safely be ignored in
    all other cases, at least for now.

    ASN1_ITEM versions of ASN1_d2i_{fp, bio} and replacement of

      not explicitely mentioned in mkdef.pl as a known algorithm) and
      report.
    * add a number of algorithms that can be deselected.
    * look in ssl/kssl.h as well.
    * accept multiple whitespace (not just one SPC) in preprocessor lines.

commit 1cc0b0a66a4197efb26c357a18f443608ed3d605

    This adds support to 'tunala' for supplying DH parameters (without which it
    will not support EDH cipher suites). The parameters can either be loaded
    from a file (via "-dh_file"), generated by the application on start-up
    ("-dh_special generate"), or be standard DH parameters (as used in
    s_server, etc).

    Some minor changes to the "tunala" demo.
    
    * Seal off some buffer functions so that only the higher-level IO functions
      are exposed.
    
    * Using the above change to buffer, add support to tunala for displaying
      traffic totals when a tunnel closes. Useful in debugging and analysis -
      you get to see the total encrypted traffic versus the total tunneled
      traffic. This shows not only how much expansion your data suffers from
      SSL (a lot if you send/receive a few bytes at a time), but also the
      overhead of SSL handshaking relative to the payload sent through the
      tunnel. This is controlled by the "-out_totals" switch to tunala.
    
    * Fix and tweak some bits in the README.
    
    Eg. sample output of "-out_totals" from a tunnel client when tunneling a brief
    "telnet" session.
    
    Tunnel closing, traffic stats follow
        SSL (network) traffic to/from server;     7305 bytes in,     3475 bytes out
        tunnelled data to/from server;            4295 bytes in,      186 bytes out

    This is an engine contributed by Broadcom - it is meant to support the
    BCM5805 and BCM5820 units. So far I've merely taken a skim over the code
    and changed a few things from their original contributed source
    (de-shadowing variables, removing variables from the header, and
    re-constifying some functions to remove warnings). If this gives
    compilation problems on any system, please let me know. We will hopefully
    know for sure whether this actually functions on a system with the relevant
    hardware in a day or two.  :-)

    Next step in tidying up the LHASH code.
    
    DECLARE/IMPLEMENT macros now exist to create type (and prototype) safe
    wrapper functions that avoid the use of function pointer casting yet retain
    type-safety for type-specific callbacks. However, most of the usage within
    OpenSSL itself doesn't really require the extra function because the hash
    and compare callbacks are internal functions declared only for use by the
    hash table. So this change catches all those cases and reimplements the
    functions using the base-level LHASH prototypes and does per-variable
    casting inside those functions to convert to the appropriate item type.
    
    The exception so far is in ssl_lib.c where the hash and compare callbacks
    are not static - they're exposed in ssl.h so their prototypes should not be
    changed. In this last case, the IMPLEMENT_LHASH_*** macros have been left
    intact.

    Fix some things that look like bugs.
    
    One problem that looked like a problem in bn_recp.c at first turned
    out to be a BN_mul bug.  An example is given in bn_recp.c; finding
    the bug responsible for this is left as an exercise.

    I haven't yet changed the comments that describe bn_mul_recursive()
    and bn_mul_part_recursive().  I want this to be tested by more people
    before I consider this change final.  Please test away!

    ANSI C doesn't allow trailing semi-colons after a function's closing brace
    so these macros probably shouldn't be used like that at all. So, this
    change removes the misleading comment and also adds an implicit trailing
    semi-colon to the DECLARE macros so they too don't require one.

    Use the new LHASH macros to declare type-safe wrapper functions that can
    be used as the hash/compare callbacks without function pointer casting.
    
    For now, this is just happening in the apps/ directory whilst a few people
    check the approach. The rest of the library will be moved across to the
    same idea if there's no problems with this.

commit dfa46e502dff4b86e6e41fbcc36c561caf20bd2e
Author: Geoff Thorpe <geoff@openssl.org>
Date:   Sat Dec 2 23:08:59 2000 +0000

    Next step in tidying up the LHASH code. This commit defines DECLARE and
    IMPLEMENT macros for defining wrapper functions for "hash" and "cmp" callbacks
    that are specific to the underlying item type in a hash-table. This prevents
    function pointer casting altogether, and also provides some type-safety
    because the macro does per-variable casting from the (void *) type used in
    LHASH itself to the type declared in the macro - and if that doesn't match the
    prototype expected by the "hash" or "cmp" function then a compiler error will
    result.
    
    NB: IMPLEMENT macros are not required unless predeclared forms are required
    (either in a header file, or further up in a C file than the implementation
    needs to be). The DECLARE macros must occur after the type-specific hash/cmp
    callbacks are declared. Also, the IMPLEMENT and DECLARE macros are such that
    they can be prefixed with "static" if desired and a trailing semi-colon should
    be appended (making it look more like a regular declaration and easier on
    auto-formatting text-editors too).
    
    Now that these macros are defined, I will next be commiting changes to a
    number of places in the library where the casting was doing bad things. After
    that, the final step will be to make the analogous changes for the lh_doall
    and lh_doall_arg functions (more specifically, their callback parameters).

    First step in tidying up the LHASH code. The callback prototypes (and
    casts) used in the lhash code are about as horrible and evil as they can
    be. For starters, the callback prototypes contain empty parameter lists.
    Yuck.
    
    This first change defines clearer prototypes - including "typedef"'d
    function pointer types to use as "hash" and "compare" callbacks, as well as
    the callbacks passed to the lh_doall and lh_doall_arg iteration functions.
    Now at least more explicit (and clear) casting is required in all of the
    dependant code - and that should be included in this commit.
    
    The next step will be to hunt down and obliterate some of the function
    pointer casting being used when it's not necessary - a particularly evil
    variant exists in the implementation of lh_doall.

    BN_mod_exp(r,a,p,m,ctx) should not be called with r == p.
    But even if this is avoided, there are still segmentation violations
    (during one of the BN_free()s at the end of test_kron
    in some cases, in other cases during BN_kronecker, or
    later in BN_sqrt; choosing a different exponentiation
    algorithm in bntest.c appears to influence when the SIGSEGV
    takes place).

    * Fix a slight bug in the state-machine. This caused the client end of a
      tunnel to not pro-actively close down when failing an SSL handshake.
    
    * Change the cert-chain callback - originally this was the same one used in
      s_client and s_server but the output's as ugly as sin, so I've prettied
      tunala's copy output up a bit (and made the output level configurable).
    
    * Remove the superfluous "errors" from the SSL state callback - these are just
      non-blocking side-effects.

Author: Bodo Möller <bodo@openssl.org>
Date:   Wed Nov 29 18:08:24 2000 +0000

    BN_to_montgomery expects its inputs to be in the interval 0 .. modulus-1,
    so we have to reduce the random numbers used in test_mont.
    
    Before this change, test_mont failed in [debug-]solaris-sparcv9-gcc
    configurations ("Montgomery multiplication test failed!" because
    the multiplication result obtained with Montgomery multiplication
    differed from the result obtained by BN_mod_mul).
    Substituing the old version of bn_gcd.c (BN_mod_inverse) did not avoid
    the problem.
    
    The strange thing is that it I did not observe any problems
    when using debug-solaris-sparcv8-gcc and solaris-sparcv9-cc,
    as well as when compiling OpenSSL 0.9.6 in the solaric-sparcv9-gcc
    configuration on the same system.

    BN_bin2bn did *not* contain an off-by-one error;

    Expand expspeed.c to make BN_kronecker timings.
    This caused a segmentation fault in calls to malloc, so I cleaned up

    Minor tweaks and improvements to the tunala demo.
    
    - Add "-cipher" and "-out_state" command line arguments to control SSL
      cipher-suites and handshake debug output respectively.
    
    - Implemented error handling for SSL handshakes that break down. This uses
      a cheat - storing a non-NULL pointer as "app_data" in the SSL structure
      when the SSL should be killed.

Date:   Sun Nov 26 18:39:27 2000 +0000

    It was a small change, but it *could* conceivably affect people - so I'm
    making a note in the CHANGES file.

commit 7abe8305016609939ee5ff0429c9e26d089c321e
Author: Geoff Thorpe <geoff@openssl.org>
Date:   Sun Nov 26 18:34:45 2000 +0000

    Ensure that the "ex_data" member of an RSA structure is initialised before
    the RSA_METHOD's "init()" handler is called, and is cleaned up after the
    RSA_METHOD's "finish()" handler is called. Custom RSA_METHODs may wish to
    initialise contexts and other specifics in the RSA structure upon creation
    and that was previously not possible - "ex_data" is where that stuff
    should go and it was being initialised too late for it to be used.

    Elliptic curves over GF(p), new BIGNUM functions, Montgomery re-implementation.
    
    These new files will not be included literally in OpenSSL, but I intend
    to integrate most of their contents.  Most file names will change,
    and when the integration is done, the superfluous files will be deleted.

    Reimplement bn_div_words, bn_add_words and bn_sub_words for VAX.
    I'm a little bit nervous about bn_div_words, as I don't know what it's
    supposed to return on overflow.  For now, I trust the rest of the
    system to give it numbers that will not cause any overflow...

commit baa257f1ed218c28d4db43e3cd2034d8da17bc09
Author: Richard Levitte <levitte@openssl.org>
Date:   Sat Nov 18 22:58:26 2000 +0000

    Remove two bn_wexpand() from BN_mul(), which is a step toward getting
    BN_mul() correctly constified, avoids two realloc()'s that aren't
    really necessary and saves memory to boot.  This required a small
    change in bn_mul_part_recursive() and the addition of variants of
    bn_cmp_words(), bn_add_words() and bn_sub_words() that can take arrays
    with differing sizes.
    
    The test results show a performance that very closely matches the
    original code from before my constification.  This may seem like a
    very small win from a performance point of view, but if one remembers
    that the variants of bn_cmp_words(), bn_add_words() and bn_sub_words()
    are not at all optimized for the moment (and there's no corresponding
    assembler code), and that their use may be just as non-optimal, I'm
    pretty confident there are possibilities...
    
    This code needs reviewing!

    I've checked again and again.  There really is no need to expand a to
    4 times it's size when bn_sqr_recursive() won't look farther than the
    original length.  Thereby, constification is no longer a problem.

    I have no idea how this comment got there, but it's certainly not
    applicable to ENGINE_ctrl()

commit ef02b10a16e027498b962cc503b24e02ef25470c
Author: Geoff Thorpe <geoff@openssl.org>
Date:   Thu Nov 16 00:15:50 2000 +0000

    Many applications that use OpenSSL with ENGINE support might face a
    situation where they've initialised the ENGINE, loaded keys (which are then
    linked to that ENGINE), and performed other checks (such as verifying
    certificate chains etc). At that point, if the application goes
    multi-threaded or multi-process it creates problems for any ENGINE
    implementations that are either not thread/process safe or that perform
    optimally when they do not have to perform locking and other contention
    management tasks at "run-time".
    
    This defines a new ENGINE_ctrl() command that can be supported by engines
    at their discretion. If ENGINE_ctrl(..., ENGINE_CTRL_HUP,...) returns an
    error then the caller should check if the *_R_COMMAND_NOT_IMPLEMENTED error
    reason was set - it may just be that the engine doesn't support or need the
    HUP command, or it could be that the attempted reinitialisation failed. A
    crude alternative is to ignore the return value from ENGINE_ctrl() (and
    clear any errors with ERR_clear_error()) and perform a test operation
    immediately after the "HUP". Very crude indeed.
    
    ENGINEs can support this command to close and reopen connections, files,
    handles, or whatever as an alternative to run-time locking when such things
    would otherwise be needed. In such a case, it's advisable for the engine
    implementations to support locking by default but disable it after the
    arrival of a HUP command, or any other indication by the application that
    locking is not required. NB: This command exists to allow an ENGINE to
    reinitialise without the ENGINE's functional reference count having to sink
    down to zero and back up - which is what is normally required for the
    finish() and init() handlers to get invoked. It would also be a bad idea
    for engine_lib to catch this command itself and interpret it by calling the
    engine's init() and finish() handlers directly, because reinitialisation
    may need special handling on a case-by-case basis that is distinct from a
    finish/init pair - eg. calling a finish() handler may invalidate the state
    stored inside individual keys that have already loaded for this engine.

    HP-UX shared libraries do not build any longer, as EX_LIBS contains
    "-Wl,+s" instead of +s:
    * Hardcoded necessary references to -ldld/-ldl into the build rules and
      removed EX_LIBS.
    
    HP-UX records the pathnames of dependent libraries when the shared libs
    are built, so that ./libcrypto.sl... is recorded in libssl.sl..., with
    "./" not being resolvable when running an application linked against -lssl:
    * Build libssl without explicit reference to libcrypto, applications will
      be linked with "-lssl -lcrypto" anyway.

    Constification of CRYPTO_get_ex_data() needed for the sake of

    The consequence of constification is that to pass the address to a

    Constify the BIGNUM routines a bit more.  The only trouble were the
    two functions that did expansion on in parameters (BN_mul() and

    a mix of bn_expand2() and BN_dup().

    Change the engine library so the application writer has to explicitely
    load the "external" built-in engines (those that require DSO).  This
    makes linking with libdl or other dso libraries non-mandatory.
    
    Change 'openssl engine' accordingly.
    
    Change the engine header files so some declarations (that differed at
    that!) aren't duplicated, and make sure engine_int.h includes
    engine.h.  That way, there should be no way of missing the needed
    info.

    'openssl engine' can now list engine capabilities.  The current
    implementation is contained in the application, and the capability
    string building part should really be part of the engine library.
    This is therefore an experimental hack, and will be changed in the
    near future.

    DSO_load() should also work when it is passed a NULL - a new DSO is created
    automatically, however some code was still referring to the original
    pointer rather than the internal one (and thus to NULL instead of the
    created pointer).

    On HP-UX, at least when shl_* are used, the libraries have the

    For the operating systems where it matters, it is sometimes good to
    translate library names by only adding ".so" to them without
    prepending them with "lib".  Add the flag DSO_FLAG_NAME_TRANSLATION_EXT_ONLY
    for that purpose.

commit 51c8dc37dd4d655cf44f07d16dc985627a8e3577
Author: Geoff Thorpe <geoff@openssl.org>
Date:   Thu Oct 26 17:38:59 2000 +0000

    This changes the behaviour of the DSO mechanism for determining an
    appropriate filename translation on the host system. Apart from this point,
    users should also note that there's a slight change in the API functions
    too. The DSO now contains its own to-be-converted filename
    ("dso->filename"), and at the time the DSO loads the "dso->loaded_filename"
    value is set to the translated form. As such, this also provides an impicit
    way of determining if the DSO is currently loaded or not. Except, perhaps,
    VMS .... :-)
    
    The various DSO_METHODs have been updated for this mechanism except VMS
    which is deliberately broken for now, Richard is going to look at how to
    fit it in (the source comments in there explain "the issue").
    
    Basically, the new callback scheme allows the filename conversion to
    (a) be turned off altogether through the use of the
        DSO_FLAG_NO_NAME_TRANSLATION flag,
    (b) be handled in the default way using the default DSO_METHOD's converter
    (c) overriden per-DSO by setting the override callback
    (d) a mix of (b) and (c) - eg. implement an override callback that;
        (i) checks if we're win32 "if(strstr(dso->meth->name, "win32"))..."
            and if so, convert "blah" into "blah32.dll" (the default is
    	otherwise to make it "blah.dll").
        (ii) default to the normal behaviour - eg. we're not on win32, so
             finish with (return dso->meth->dso_name_converter(dso,NULL)).
    (e) be retried a number of times by writing a new DSO_METHOD where the
        "dso_load()" handler will call the converter repeatedly. Then the
        custom converter could use state information in the DSO to suggest
        different conversions or paths each time it is invoked.

    When building shared libraries on HP-UX 10.20 and HP-UX 11.00 (32bit),
    ld warns that -Fl "may not be supported in future releases".  We know
    that, and are doing things in HP-UX 11 (64bit), so turn off that
    warning with +vnocompatwarnings.

    FreeBSD-elf can do threads.  However, there seems to be confusion if
    you should defined _THREAD_SAFE (I found that in an include file, and
    that's what everybody tells me) or _THREADSAFE (that's what the gcc
    manual says in the FreeBSD-specific section), so I defined both, just
    to be safe.

    NCONF_get_number() has no error checking at all.  As a replacement,
    NCONF_get_number_e() is defined (_e for "error checking") and is
    promoted strongly.  The old NCONF_get_number is kept around for
    binary backward compatibility.

    Even when you don't want to create shared libraries, it's a good idea
    to have the full extension information, so residual shared libraries
    can be removed so the applications and test programs do not get linked
    against them by mistake...

    Rework the system to generate shared libraries:
    
      - Make note of the expected extension for the shared libraries and
        if there is a need for symbolic links from for example libcrypto.so.0
        to libcrypto.so.0.9.7.  There is extended info in Configure for
        that.
    
      - Make as few rebuilds of the shared libraries as possible.
    
      - Still avoid linking the OpenSSL programs with the shared libraries.
    
      - When installing, install the shared libraries separately from the
        static ones.

    Ugly hack to make sure static libraries are usable.  Without this,

    The right thing would really be to fix crypto/rand/rand_win.c to load
    ADVAPI32.DLL dynamically, but that won't be done just before a

    Wrong variable used.  It's funny how some bugs take a long time
    getting triggered...

commit 645749ef98612340b11c4bf2ba856e1fa469912b
Author: Richard Levitte <levitte@openssl.org>
Date:   Wed Sep 20 13:55:50 2000 +0000

    On VMS, stdout may very well lead to a file that is written to in a
    record-oriented fashion.  That means that every write() will write a
    separate record, which will be read separately by the programs trying
    to read from it.  This can be very confusing.
    
    The solution is to put a BIO filter in the way that will buffer text
    until a linefeed is reached, and then write everything a line at a
    time, so every record written will be an actual line, not chunks of
    lines and not (usually doesn't happen, but I've seen it once) several
    lines in one record.  Voila, BIO_f_linebuffer() is born.
    
    Since we're so close to release time, I'm making this VMS-only for
    now, just to make sure no code is needlessly broken by this.  After
    the release, this BIO method will be enabled on all other platforms as
    well.

    Totally remove the supposedly 'faster' variant in
    BN_mod_mul_montgomery, which calls bn_sqr_recursive
    without much preparation.
    
    bn_sqr_recursive requires the length of its argument to be
    a power of 2, which is not always the case here.
    There's no reason for not using BN_sqr -- if a simpler
    approach to squaring made sense, then why not change
    BN_sqr?  (Using BN_sqr should also speed up DH where g is chosen
    such that it becomes small [e.g., 2] when converted
    to Montgomery representation.)
    
    Case closed :-)

    Later, Jeffrey changed his mind.  Apparently, GetCursorInfo exists but
    doesn't quite work on WinNT 4 earlier than SP6.  It works fine on
    Windows 98 and Windows 2000.
    
    I'm disabling it for now.  What's really needed is some kind of check
    to see if GetCursorInfo is safe to call, or alternatively, GetCursor
    or GetCursorPos could be used, according to Jeffrey.

    3 changes:
    - Make sure PCURSORINFO is defined even on systems that do not provide it.
    - Change the reference to Peter Gutmann's paper.
    - Make sure we don't walk the whole heap lists for performance reasons.
      Jeffrey Altman suggests following Peter Gutmann's advice to keep it
      to 50 heap entries per heap list.

    Major hack of mkdef.pl.  There should be no more need to redo the
    process when some symbols are missing.  Instead, all needed info is
    saved in the .num files, including what conditions are needed for a
    specific symbol to exist.
    
    This was needed for the work I'm doing with shared libraries under
    VMS.

    Change the printing mahine used by BIO_printf() and friends so it can
    handle an externally provided "static" buffer as well a a dynamic
    buffer.  The "static" buffer is filled first, but if overflowed, the
    dynamic buffer is used instead, being allocated somewhere i the heap.
    
    This combines the benefits of putting the output in a preallocated
    buffer (on the stack, for example) and in a buffer that grows
    somewhere in the heap.

    Another round of indentation changes: Position braces consistently,
    add some whitespace for 'if ()', 'for ()', 'while ()' to distinguish
    keywords from function names, and finally remove parens around return
    values (why be stingy with whitespace but fill the source code
    with an abundance of parentheses that are not needed to structure
    expressions for readability?).

    More indentation consistency: for (), while (), if (), return ()
    usually get a space between keyword and opening paranthesis
    so that they don't look like function calls, where no space is

Author: Dr. Stephen Henson <steve@openssl.org>
Date:   Tue Sep 5 17:53:58 2000 +0000

    *BIG* verify code reorganisation.
    
    The old code was painfully primitive and couldn't handle
    distinct certificates using the same subject name.
    
    The new code performs several tests on a candidate issuer
    certificate based on certificate extensions.
    
    It also adds several callbacks to X509_VERIFY_CTX so its
    behaviour can be customised.
    
    Unfortunately some hackery was needed to persuade X509_STORE
    to tolerate this. This should go away when X509_STORE is
    replaced, sometime...
    
    This must have broken something though :-(

    Remove silly test for b->references at the end of BIO_write:
    If some other thread deletes the BIO that one thread needs for
    BIO_write, then there's a lot of trouble anyway; there's

    New option 'ctestall' for mkdef.pl, that makes it not only generate

    Abdelilah Essiari <aes@george.lbl.gov> reports that for very small
    records, EVP_EncodeUpdate() may misbehave.  This happens when there's
    a record boundary between the two ending b64 equal signs, which makes
    EVP_EncodeUpdate think there has been more than one EOF, and therefore
    add an extra NUL at the end of the output buffer.  This fix corrects
    that problem.

    It's probably a good idea to make the shared libraries depend in EX_LIBS.

Date:   Wed Aug 2 03:03:17 2000 +0000

    A few corrections with the shared library support:
    
    1. make sure libssl.so becomes dependent on libcrypto.so
    2. correct a number of silly bugs in the solaris-shared target, and make
       sure lib*.so also depends on libc.so.

    Make it so we can dynamically enable memory allocation debugging through the
    environment variable OPENSSL_DEBUG_MEMORY (existence is sufficient).  At the
    same time, it makes sure that CRYPTO_malloc_debug_init() gets expanded some-
    where and thereby tested for compilation.

    Fix SSL 2.0 rollback checking: The previous implementation of the
    test was never triggered due to an off-by-one error.
    
    In s23_clnt.c, don't use special rollback-attack detection padding
    (RSA_SSLV23_PADDING) if SSL 2.0 is the only protocol enabled in the
    client; similarly, in s23_srvr.c, don't do the rollback check if
    SSL 2.0 is the only protocol enabled in the server.

    New ASN1_STRING_print_ex() and X509_NAME_print_ex()
    functions. These are intended to be replacements
    for the ancient ASN1_STRING_print() and X509_NAME_print()
    functions.
    
    The new functions support RFC2253 and various pretty
    printing options. It is also possible to display
    international characters if the terminal properly handles
    UTF8 encoding (Linux seems to tolerate this if the
    "unicode_start" script is run).
    
    Still needs to be documented, integrated into other
    utilities and extensively tested.

    There's a slight possibility that a is 0 in BN_sub_word(), and might
    therefore have unallocated parts.  Therefore, a check for the 0 case
    is needed, resulting with the same thing as when a is negative.

    When data are written out in very small blocks (less than 3 bytes in
    size) through the base64 filter, b64_write() messes up it's parameters
    in such a way that instead of writing correct base64 output, the first
    4 characters of that output is repeated over and over.  This fix
    corrects that problem.

    There's a deadlock when ssleay_rand_bytes is called the first time, since
    it wants to stir the pool using ssleay_rand_add.  This fix provides the
    possibility to call ssleay_rand_add inside a locked state by simply telling
    it not to do any locking through a static variable.  This isn't the most
    elegant way one could do this, but it does retain thread safety during the
    stirring process.

commit b436a98257986c0026469487f6e7ec44c9e4825a
Author: Richard Levitte <levitte@openssl.org>
Date:   Fri Jul 21 15:08:53 2000 +0000

    Redo and enhance the support for building shared libraries.  Currently
    there's support for building under Linux and True64 (using examples
    from the programming manuals), including versioning that is currently
    the same as OpenSSL versions but should really be a different series.
    
    With this change, it's up to the users to decide if they want shared
    libraries as well as the static ones.  This decision now has to be
    done at configuration time (well, not really, those who know what they
    do can still do it the same way as before).
    
    The OpenSSL programs (openssl and the test programs) are currently
    always linked statically, but this may change in the future in a
    configurable manner.  The necessary makefile variables to enable this
    are in place.
    
    Also note that I have done absolutely nothing about the Windows target
    to get something similar.  On the other hand, DLLs are already the
    default there, but without versioning, and I've no idea what the
    possibilities for such a thing are there...

    I got sick and tired of having to keep track of NIDs when such a thing
    could be done automagically, much like the numbering in libeay.num and
    ssleay.num.  The solution works as follows:
    
      - New object identifiers are inserted in objects.txt, following the
        syntax given in objects.README.
      - objects.pl is used to process obj_mac.num and create a new
        obj_mac.h.
      - obj_dat.pl is used to create a new obj_dat.h, using the data in
        obj_mac.h.
    
    This is currently kind of a hack, and the perl code in objects.pl
    isn't very elegant, but it works as I intended.  The simplest way to
    check that it worked correctly is to look in obj_dat.h and check the
    array nid_objs and make sure the objects haven't moved around (this is
    important!).  Additions are OK, as well as consistent name changes.

    Change mkstack.pl so it now sorts each group
    into lexical order. Previously it depended on
    the order of files in the directory.
    
    This should now mean that all systems will

    not change it needlessly and avoid massive
    needless commits to safestack.h in future.
    
    It wont however avoid this one :-(

    Fixes for Win32 build.
    
    This is mostly a work around for the old VC++ problem
    that it treats func() as func(void).
    
    Various prototypes had been added to 'compare' function
    pointers that triggered this. This could be fixed by removing
    the prototype, adding function pointer casts to every call or
    changing the passed function to use the expected arguments.
    I mostly did the latter.
    
    The mkdef.pl script was modified to remove the typesafe
    functions which no longer exist.
    
    Oh and some functions called OPENSSL_freeLibrary() were
    changed back to FreeLibrary(), wonder how that happened :-)

    Also, to avoid one thread freeing a lock that is used by another, a
    reference counter is added.

    Add support for dynamically created and destroyed mutexes.  This will
    be needed in some ENGINE code, and might serve elsewhere as well.
    Note that it's implemented in such a way that the locking itself is
    done through the same CRYPTO_lock function as the static locks.
    
    WARNING: This is currently experimental and untested code (it will get
    tested soon, though :-)).

    First of all, with the current macros, we should never get any

    Safe stack reorganisation in terms of function casts.
    
    After some messing around this seems to work but needs
    a few more tests. Working out the syntax for sk_set_cmp_func()
    (cast it to a function that itself returns a function pointer)
    was painful :-(
    
    Needs some testing to see what other compilers think of this
    syntax.
    
    Also needs similar stuff for ASN1_SET_OF etc etc.

    Currently the DSO_METHOD interface has one entry point to bind all
    "symbols" including functions (of all prototypes( and variables. Whilst
    casting any function type to another violates ANSI C (I believe), it is
    a necessary evil in shared-library APIs. However, it is quite
    conceivable that functions in general and data symbols could very well
    be represented differently to each other on some systems, as Bodo said;
    
    > Since the function/object distinction is a lot more likely to be
    > important on real-life platforms supporting DSO *and* it can be quite
    > easily done *and* it will silence compilers that don't like
    > assignments from void pointers to function pointer variables, why
    > not do it?
    
    I agree. So this change splits the "dso_bind" handler in DSO_METHOD
    into "dso_bind_var" and "dso_bind_func". Similarly the exported
    function DSO_bind() has been split in two. I've also put together
    changes for the various DSO_METHOD implementations, but so far only
    DSO_dlfcn() has been tested. BTW: The prototype for dso_bind had been
    a bit strange so I've taken the opportunity to change its shape (in
    both variations).
    
    Also, the README has been updated - particularly with a note about
    using customised native name-translation for shared libraries (and that
    you can't do it yet).

    Using checks of the existence of HEADER_{foo}_H in other header files
    was a really bad idea.  For example, the following:
    
    	#include <x509.h>
    	#include <bio.h>
    	#include <asn1.h>
    
    would make sure that things like ASN1_UTCTIME_print() wasn't defined
    unless you moved the inclusion of bio.h to above the inclusion of
    x509.h.  The reason is that x509.h includes asn1.h, and the
    declaration of ASN1_UTCTIME_print() depended on the definition of
    HEADER_BIO_H.  That's what I call an obscure bug.
    
    Instead, this change makes sure that whatever header files are needed
    for the correct process of one header file are included automagically,
    and that the definitions of, for example, BIO-related things are
    dependent on the absence of the NO_{foo} macros.  This is also
    consistent with the way parts of OpenSSL can be excluded at will.

    Use the equivalent of a sliding window (without precomputation
    because we're only handling words anyway) in BN_mod_exp_mont_word
    making it a little faster for very small exponents,
    and adjust the performance gain estimate in CHANGES according
    to slightly more thorough measurements.
    (15% faster than BN_mod_exp_mont for "large" base,
    20% faster than BN_mod_exp_mont for small base.)

    "make update" + stripping the type-specific stack functions out of
    libeay.num and ssleay.num.

commit e41c8d6ad4d1ffab51865d8cf90baff108bbe4a1
Author: Geoff Thorpe <geoff@openssl.org>
Date:   Thu Jun 1 05:13:52 2000 +0000

    This change will cause builds (by default) to not use different STACK
    structures and functions for each stack type. The previous behaviour
    can be enabled by configuring with the "-DDEBUG_SAFESTACK" option.
    This will also cause "make update" (mkdef.pl in particular) to
    update the libeay.num and ssleay.num symbol tables with the number of
    extra functions DEBUG_SAFESTACK creates.
    
    The way this change works is to accompany each DECLARE_STACK_OF()
    macro with a set of "#define"d versions of the sk_##type##_***
    functions that ensures all the existing "type-safe" stack calls are
    precompiled into the underlying stack calls. The presence or abscence
    of the DEBUG_SAFESTACK symbol controls whether this block of
    "#define"s or the DECLARE_STACK_OF() macro is taking effect. The
    block of "#define"s is in turn generated and maintained by a perl
    script (util/mkstack.pl) that encompasses the block with delimiting
    C comments. This works in a similar way to the auto-generated error
    codes and, like the other such maintenance utilities, is invoked
    by the "make update" target.
    
    A long (but mundane) commit will follow this with the results of
    "make update" - this will include all the "#define" blocks for
    each DECLARE_STACK_OF() statement, along with stripped down
    libeay.num and ssleay.num files.

commit ccd86b68ef7f9a5cfaaed4089bce29fdc5fe4219
Author: Geoff Thorpe <geoff@openssl.org>
Date:   Thu Jun 1 02:36:58 2000 +0000

    The previous commit to crypto/stack/*.[ch] pulled the type-safety strings
    yet tighter, and also put some heat on the rest of the library by
    insisting (correctly) that compare callbacks used in stacks are prototyped
    with "const" parameters. This has led to a depth-first explosion of
    compiler warnings in the code where 1 constification has led to 3 or 4
    more. Fortunately these have all been resolved to completion and the code
    seems cleaner as a result - in particular many of the _cmp() functions
    should have been prototyped with "const"s, and now are. There was one
    little problem however;
    
    X509_cmp() should by rights compare "const X509 *" pointers, and it is now
    declared as such. However, it's internal workings can involve
    recalculating hash values and extensions if they have not already been
    setup. Someone with a more intricate understanding of the flow control of
    X509 might be able to tighten this up, but for now - this seemed the
    obvious place to stop the "depth-first" constification of the code by
    using an evil cast (they have migrated all the way here from safestack.h).
    
    Fortunately, this is the only place in the code where this was required
    to complete these type-safety changes, and it's reasonably clear and
    commented, and seemed the least unacceptable of the options. Trying to
    take the constification further ends up exploding out considerably, and
    indeed leads directly into generalised ASN functions which are not likely
    to cooperate well with this.

commit 7bb7043580900b8f06cb418b46004b755ff0fc96
Author: Geoff Thorpe <geoff@openssl.org>
Date:   Thu Jun 1 02:15:40 2000 +0000

    This is the first of two commits (didn't want to dump them all into the
    same one). However, the first will temporarily break things until the
    second comes through. :-)
    
    The safestack.h handling was mapping compare callbacks that externally
    are of the type (int (*)(type **,type **)) into the underlying callback
    type used by stack.[ch], which is (int (*)(void *,void *)). After some
    degree of digging, it appears that the callback type in the underlying
    stack code should use double pointers too - when the compare operations
    are invoked (from sk_find and sk_sort), they are being used by bsearch
    and qsort to compare two pointers to pointers. This change corrects the
    prototyping (by only casting to the (void*,void*) form at the moment
    it is needed by bsearch and qsort) and makes the mapping in safestack.h
    more transparent. It also changes from "void*" to "char*" to stay in
    keeping with stack.[ch]'s assumed base type of "char".
    
    Also - the "const" situation was that safestack.h was throwing away
    "const"s, and to compound the problem - a close examination of stack.c
    showed that (const char **) is not really achieving what it is supposed
    to when the callback is being invoked, what is needed is
    (const char * const *). So the underlying stack.[ch] and the mapping
    macros in safestack.h have all been altered to correct this.
    
    What will follow are the vast quantities of "const" corrections required
    in stack-dependant code that was being let "slip" through when
    safestack.h was discarding "const"s. These now all come up as compiler
    warnings.

    All the little functions created by the IMPLEMENT_STACK_OF() macro will
    cast their type-specific STACK into a real STACK and call the underlying
    sk_*** function. The problem is that if the STACK_OF(..) parameter being
    passed in has a "const *" qualifier, it is discarded by the cast.
    
    I'm currently implementing a fix for this but in the mean-time, this is
    one case I noticed (a few type-specific sk_**_num() functions pass in
    const type-specific stacks). If there are other errors in the code where
    consts are being discarded, we will similarly not notice them. yuck.

    This declaration seems to have been added into the header file accidently.
    There's no trace of it being implemented and it doesn't seem to have been

    Second phase of EVP cipher overhaul.
    
    Change functions like EVP_EncryptUpdate() so they now return a
    value. These normally have software only implementations
    which cannot fail so this was acceptable. However ciphers
    can be implemented in hardware and these could return errors.

    Beginnings of EVP cipher overhaul. This should eventually
    enhance and tidy up the EVP interface.
    
    This patch adds initial support for variable length ciphers
    and changes S/MIME code to use this.
    
    Some other library functions need modifying to support use
    of modified cipher parameters.
    
    Also need to change all the cipher functions that should
    return error codes, but currenly don't.
    
    And of course it needs extensive testing...

    This case in the "dso_unload" handlers should not be reported as an error -
    if a DSO_load(NULL,...) operation fails, it will have to call DSO_free() on
    the DSO structure it created and that will filter through to this "unload"
    call.
    
    If the stack size is "< 1", then the library never actually loaded. To keep
    things clean higher up, I'll treat this as a vacuous case without an error.
    It makes the error stack easier to follow real world cases, and the error
    this ignores was only useful for catching bugs in internal code, not
    mismatched calls from applications (which should be handled in the generic
    DSO layer).

commit da414db464cd7393ac8642dd1d285fd8be4a4c2a
Author: Geoff Thorpe <geoff@openssl.org>

    The handling of DSA_METHOD and DH_METHOD wasn't quite as problematic as
    with RSA_METHOD (the **_get_default_methods do set the default value if
    it's not set). However, the code had some duplication and was a bit
    conter-intuitive.

commit deb4d50e5125f7c26f36ac31b7c63ef805df9a85
Author: Geoff Thorpe <geoff@openssl.org>
Date:   Thu Apr 20 06:44:18 2000 +0000

    Previously, the default RSA_METHOD was NULL until the first RSA structure was
    initialised, at which point an appropriate default was chosen. This meant a
    call to RSA_get_default_method might have returned FALSE.
    
    This change fixes that; now any called to RSA_new(), RSA_new_method(NULL), or
    RSA_get_default_method() will ensure that a default is chosen if it wasn't
    already.

    This change facilitates name translation for shared libraries. The
    technique used is far from perfect and alternatives are welcome.
    Basically if the translation flag is set, the string is not too
    long, and there appears to be no path information in the string,
    then it is converted to whatever the standard should be for the
    DSO_METHOD in question, eg;
        blah --> libblah.so   on *nix, and
        blah --> blah.dll     on win32.
    
    This change also introduces the DSO_ctrl() function that is used
    by the name translation stuff.

    I have retained the old behavior of the CONF_* functions, and have
    added a more "object oriented" interface through NCONF_* functions
    (New CONF, you see :-)), working the same way as, for example, the
    BIO interface.  Really, the CONF_* are rewritten so they use the
    NCONF_* functions internally.
    
    In addition to that, I've split the old conf.c code into two files,
    conf_def.c and conf_api.c.  conf_def.c contains the default config
    object that reads a configuration file the standard OpenSSL way, as
    well as configuration file with Win32 registry file syntax (I'm not
    sure I got that one right).  conf_api.c provides an API to build other
    configuration file readers around (can you see a configuraion file in
    XML?  I can :-)).
    
    Finally, I've changed the name conf_lcl.h to conf_def.h, since it's
    made specifically for that "class" and none others.

    I forgot about $openssl_other_defines ... should probably do this
    for consistency. Not sure though whether HAVE_DLFCN_H should be
    included too? If we go the autoconf route then this probably wouldn't
    be included.

    This helps make the DSO stuff more portable;
    * "no-dso" option available in Configure so that all DSO methods will
      return NULL, overriding any support the platform might otherwise
      have built.
    * dlfcn_no_h config string now available rather than just dlfcn. This
      is for platforms that have dlfcn.h functions but do not have (or
      need) the dlfcn.h header file.

    Better make a note of what's going on ... :-)

commit 9ec0126ed2b943acf844de90fce5871b6a57960f
Author: Geoff Thorpe <geoff@openssl.org>
Date:   Tue Apr 4 22:32:19 2000 +0000

    This commit ties the new DSO code (crypto/dso/) into the build for a
    variety of platforms. A few are missing, and they will be added in
    eventually, but as this is new stuff, it was better to not break lots of
    platforms in one go that we can't easily test. The changes to "Configure"
    should illustrate how to add support to other systems if you feel like
    having a go.
    
    NB: I'll add something shortly to allow you to add "dlfcn.h" support on
    those platforms that don't have (or need) a dlfcn.h header file. (The
    symbol for Configure will probably by "dlfcn_no_h").
    
    Thanks to Richard Levitte, who is responsible for the dso_dl.c support,
    understanding the trickier aspects of the build process, and giving great
    feedback on everything else.
    
    [Don't use this stuff if you're easily offended by changes to the
    interface or behaviour - it's still work in progress.]

commit 8f4fac7f965b4604bc71be4bd486a8641c0504ab
Author: Geoff Thorpe <geoff@openssl.org>

    This is a set of startup code for the DSO support, it's not yet linked into
    the build process (an upcoming commit no doubt), and is very much *new*
    code - what that means is that it compiles ok - usually. It certainly
    doesn't mean it runs well or even properly yet. Please don't muck round
    with this unless you're looking to help out and hunt bugs. :-)
    
    Currently this code doesn't have any support for controlling the "load"
    behaviour (eg. paths, filename translations, etc). That'll be handled
    using DSO_ctrl() and various flags, once we work out a sensible set of
    flags.

Author: Richard Levitte <levitte@openssl.org>
Date:   Sun Mar 19 09:35:19 2000 +0000

    Change the notation and coding of the version to be able to contain
    both a patch level and a beta status.  IMHO, it also makes more sense
    to have beta status be part of the development status than to have it
    be an alternate name for patch levels under special conditions.

    Their solution for CRAY is somewhat awkward.
    I'll assume that a "short" is 32 bits on CRAY to avoid the

    Remove "Makefile.uni" files and some related stuff.
    This was meant for building individual ciphers separately;
    but nothing of this is maintained, it does not work
    because we rely on central configuration by the Configure
    utility with <openssl/opensslconf.h> etc., so the files
    are only wasting space and time.

    Copy DH key (if available) in addition to the bare parameters
    in SSL_new.
    If SSL_OP_SINGLE_DH_USE is set, don't waste time in SSL_[CTX_]set_tmp_dh
    on computing a DH key that will be ignored anyway.
    
    ssltest -dhe1024dsa (w/ 160-bit sub-prime) had an unfair performance
    advantage over -dhe1024 (safe prime): SSL_OP_SINGLE_DH_USE was
    effectively always enabled because SSL_new ignored the DH key set in
    the SSL_CTX.  Now -dhe1024 takes the server only about twice as long
    as -dhe1024dsa instead of three times as long (for 1024 bit RSA
    with 1024 bit DH).

Date:   Fri Mar 10 13:23:20 2000 +0000

    Always use fixed DH parameters created with 'dhparam -C',
    don't dynamically create them.  This allows using ssltest
    for approximate performance comparisons:
       $ time ./ssltest -num 50 -tls1 -cert ../apps/server2.pem \
         [-no_dhe|-dhe1024dsa|-dhe1024]
    (server2.pem contains a 1024 bit RSA key, the default has only
    512 bits.) Note that these timings contain both the server's and
    the client's computations, they are not a good indicator for
    server workload in different configurations.

    Add the possibility (with -ign_eof) to ignore end of file on input but
    still not be quiet.  Also make it clear that -quiet implicitely means
    -ign_eof as well.

    Change to code generated by 'dhparam -C':
    
    - Move DH parameter components inside the function.
    - Automatically #include the required header file if it
      has not already been #included.

    Shared library support for Solaris and HPUX
    by Lutz Behnke and by Lutz Jaenicke.
    
    Hopefully we'll have a unified way of handling shared libraries when
    we move to autoconf...

    Ouch! PKCS7_encrypt() was heading MIME text headers twice
    because it added them manually and as part of SMIME_crlf_copy().
    Removed the manual add.

    Short is always promoted to int when passed as a function argument.
    This is especially true when it's part of a '...'.

    Include rand.h so RAND_pseudo_bytes may be declared.
    Remove one ampersand so the compiler may complain less.
    Make rand() static so it will not conflict with the C RTL.
    Make bug() static too, for good measure.

    Use standard header file string.h for memset prototype (where
    "standard" refers to the C language, probably there's also some

    New logical names to skip algorithms are now supported.
    Also, on Alpha, vms.mar is no longer used (it produced a lot of
    confusing messages) for BN.  Instead, the assembler part of bn_lcl.h
    is used.

    New "target": CONFIG.  This will build the opensslconf.h file from
    what is known about VAX and Alpha running VMS, and from the
    opensslconf.h.in (in VMS often named OPENSSLCONF.H_IN) file.

    The OpenVMS library is most definitely not built for anything but
    files, unless it's all in unixly syntax.  We can't guarantee that
    right now, so let's skip the whole test suit.  There are other places
    (like the open()) where errors are detected anyway.

Author: Richard Levitte <levitte@openssl.org>
Date:   Sat Feb 26 01:55:56 2000 +0000

    ftruncate() and fileno() are not supported on all versions of OpenVMS
    (they don't really exist before version 7), so that solution was toast.
    Instead, let's do it the way it's done on Unix, but then remove older
    versions of the file.
    
    That new mechanism *may* fail for some unixly formated file spec,
    although I wouldn't worry too much about it.

    Since a stack with quite long name is declared here, vms_idhacks.h is
    also needed to get around C compilers on VMS that set the symbol limit
    to 31 characters.  Bot the macros VMS and __VMS are checked, since
    there's no real way to know if e_os.h has been included yet.

    Update the two threads modules to conform to our recommendations (use
    CRYPTO_num_locks() instead of CRYPTO_NUM_LOCKS!), and correct all the
    inconsistencies with the rest of OpenSSL.
    
    At least, this compiles nicely on Linux using PTHREADS.  I've done no
    other tests so far.

    I haven't got mismatches so far. If you can, please run the test
    program for a few days (nohup divtest >out& or something), and if it
    reports a mismatch, post the output.

    There're two (incompatible) ways to write multi-threaded programs under
    IRIX, one is to call sproc(2) when every thread does get own pid and
    POSIX threads when all the threads share same pid.

    Check tlen size in all padding_check functions. As called within the rsa
    library, the output buffer always is large enough, but if the tlen
    parameter is there, it should be checked in the interest of clarity,
    as proposed by David Sacerdote <das33@cornell.edu>.

Date:   Mon Feb 21 10:16:30 2000 +0000

    Move MAC computations for Finished from ssl3_read_bytes into
    ssl3_get_message, which is more logical (and avoids a bug,
    in addition to the one that I introduced yesterday :-)
    and makes Microsoft "fast SGC" less special.
    MS SGC should still work now without an extra state of its own
    (it goes directly to SSL3_ST_SR_CLNT_HELLO_C, which is the usual state
    for reading the body of a Client Hello message), however this should
    be tested to make sure, and I don't have a MS SGC client.

    Move the registration of callback functions to special functions
    designed for that.  This removes the potential error to mix data and
    function pointers.
    
    Please note that I'm a little unsure how incorrect calls to the old
    ctrl functions should be handled, in som cases.  I currently return 0
    and that's it, but it may be more correct to generate a genuine error
    in those cases.

    Avoid potential conflicts between #defines in opensslconf.h and
    defines when compiling applications, and allow applications to
    select what #defines to enable -- OPENSSL_EXLUCDE_DEFINES
    enables the "#define NO_whatever" stuff only, which avoids
    potential severe confusion caused by "#define _REENTRANT" when
    opensslconf.h is not the first header file #included.

    Make sure the return value of by_file_ctrl(..., X509_L_FILE_LOAD, ...)
    aka X509_LOOKUP_load_file(...) is always 0 or 1, not the counter
    returned from the recently introduced function X509_load_cert_crl_file.
    X509_STORE_load_locations expects X509_LOOKUP_load_file to return 1 on
    success, and possibly there's other software that relies on this too.

    test_mont was exercising 100-bit multiplication modulus X*I-bit, where
    X is 5120 on 32-bit and 151552 on 64-bit architectures and I varies
    from 0 to 4. As result the test was *unreasonably* slow and virtually
    impossible to complete on 64-bit architectures (e.g. IRIX bc couldn't
    even swallow such long lines).

    Remove the access() call altogether for VMS, since it doesn't quite
    work for directory specifications (this will be reported as a bug to
    DEC^H^H^HCompaq).  It could as well be removed for all others as well,
    since stat() and open() will return appropriate errors as well, but I
    leave that to someone else to decide.

Date:   Fri Feb 4 15:16:22 2000 +0000

    New xcbc_ok test vector is required after the parity bits in cbc2_key
    were fixed up. The catch is that in the DESX test the cbc2_key is used
    as whitening key where *all* 64 bits are significant.

    Support for "multiply high" instruction, see BN_UMULT_HIGH comment in
    crypto/bn/bn_lcl.h for further details. It should be noted that for
    the moment of this writing the code was tested only on Alpha. If
    compiled with DEC C the C implementation exhibits 12% performance
    improvement over the crypto/bn/asm/alpha.s (on EV56 box running
    AlphaLinux). GNU C is (unfortunately) 8% behind the assembler
    implementation. But it's OpenVMS Alpha users who *may* benefit most
    as 'apps/openssl speed rsa' exhibits 6 (six) times performance
    improvement over the original VMS bignum implementation. Where "*may*"
    means "as soon as code is enabled though #define SIXTY_FOUR_BIT and
    crypto/bn/asm/vms.mar is skipped."

    Since pod2man is still evolving, and some sites (among others dev.openssl.org)
    don't have a version that will handle the L<foo(1)|foo(1)> construct yet, here
    is a copy from my laptop (slightly modifed to work independently of the place
    where perl itself resides).

Author: Bodo Möller <bodo@openssl.org>
Date:   Mon Jan 24 10:03:24 2000 +0000

    RAND_load_file(..., -1) now means "read the complete file";
    this is what we now use to read $RANDFILE / $HOME/.rnd.
    (Previously, after 'cat'ting lots of stuff into .rnd
    only the first MB would be looked at.)
    
    Bugfix for apps/enc.c: Continue if RAND_pseudo_bytes returns 0
    (only -1 is an error).

Date:   Mon Jan 24 09:32:20 2000 +0000

    RAND_pseudo_bytes is good enough for encryption IVs,
    we should not need RAND_bytes (and we cannot use the latter
    unless we load a seed file)

    Under VMS, ftruncate should be available

Author: Bodo Möller <bodo@openssl.org>
Date:   Sun Jan 23 19:58:03 2000 +0000

    As ftruncate is not availabe on all platforms, switch back to
    opening the output file with "wb" to truncate it except on VMS
    (where the file now keeps its original length because it is opened
    with "rb+" -- does VMS have ftruncate?)

    In RAND_write_file, truncate the file to the no. of bytes written
    (we're now using fopen(..., "rb+") instead of fopen(..., "wb"),

    Compaq C 6.2 for VMS will complain when we want to convert
    non-function pointers to function pointers and vice versa.
    The current solution is to have unions that describe the
    conversion we want to do, and gives us the ability to extract
    the type of data we want.
    
    The current solution is a quick fix, and can probably be made
    in a more general or elegant way.

    - Pseudo-seed the PRNG in programs used for "make test"
      because otherwise BN_rand will fail unless DEVRANDOM works,
      which causes the programs to dump core because they
      don't check the return value of BN_rand (and if they
      did, we still couldn't test anything).
    
    - add comment to some files that appear not to be used at all.

    Precautions against using the PRNG uninitialized: RAND_bytes() now
    returns int (1 = ok, 0 = not seeded). New function RAND_add() is the
    same as RAND_seed() but takes an estimate of the entropy as an additional
    argument.

    Unify doc/openssl.pod and doc/man/openssl.pod, which were almost the
    same and now are identical.
    The next step will be to delete doc/openssl.pod, this is just

     - Added more documentation in CHANGES.
     - Made CRYPTO_MDEBUG even less used in crypto.h, giving
       MemCheck_start() and MemCheck_stop() only one possible definition.
     - Made the values of the debug function pointers in mem.c dependent
       on the existence of the CRYPTO_MDEBUG macro, and made the rest of
       the code understand the NULL case.
    
    That's it.  With this code, the old behvior of the debug functionality
    is restored, but you can still opt to have it on, even when the
    library wasn't compiled with a defined CRYPTO_MDEBUG.

    Add missing semicolon to make compiler happy, and switch back
    from MemCheck_start() to CRYPTO_mem_ctrl(CRYPTO_MEM_CHECK_ON)
    because that is what applications should use
    (MemCheck_start/stop never really worked for applications
    unless CRYPTO_MDEBUG was defined both when compiling the library
    and when compiling the application, so probably we should
    get rid of it).

    Rebuild of the OpenSSL memory allocation and deallocation routines.
    With this change, the following is provided and present at all times
    (meaning CRYPTO_MDEBUG is no longer required to get this functionality):
    
      - hooks to provide your own allocation and deallocation routines.
        They have to have the same interface as malloc(), realloc() and
        free().  They are registered by calling CRYPTO_set_mem_functions()
        with the function pointers.
    
      - hooks to provide your own memory debugging routines.  The have to
        have the same interface as as the CRYPTO_dbg_*() routines.  They
        are registered by calling CRYPTO_set_mem_debug_functions() with
        the function pointers.
    
    I moved everything that was already built into OpenSSL and did memory
    debugging to a separate file (mem_dbg.c), to make it clear what is
    what.
    
    With this, the relevance of the CRYPTO_MDEBUG has changed.  The only
    thing in crypto/crypto.h that it affects is the definition of the
    MemCheck_start and MemCheck_stop macros.

    Add functions des_set_key_checked, des_set_key_unchecked.
    Never use des_set_key (it depends on the global variable des_check_key),
    but usually des_set_key_unchecked.
    Only destest.c bothered to look at the return values of des_set_key,
    but it did not set des_check_key -- if it had done so,
    most checks would have failed because of wrong parity and
    because of weak keys.

    This corrects the reference count handling in SSL_get_session.
    Previously, the returned SSL_SESSION didn't have its reference count
    incremented so the SSL_SESSION could be freed at any time causing
    seg-faults if the pointer was subsequently used. Code that uses
    SSL_get_session must now make a corresponding SSL_SESSION_free() call when
    it is done to avoid memory leaks (or blocked up session caches).

    Two changes have been made:
    
      1. Added code to the memory leak detecting code to give the user the
         possibility to add information, thereby forming a traceback.
    
      2. Make the memory leak detecting code multithread-safe.
    
    The idea is that we're actually dealing with two separate critical
    sections, one containing the hash tables with the information, the
    other containing the current memory checking mode.  Those should not
    be handled with the same lock, especially since their handling overlap.
    Hence, the added second lock.

    Fix a couple of outstanding issues: update STATUS file, fix NO_FP_API problems.
    
    Update docs, change 'ca' to use the new callback parameter. Now moved key_callback
    into app.c because some other utilities will use it soon.

    Fix to the -revoke option in ca. It was leaking memory, crashing and just
    plain not working :-(
    
    Also fix some memory leaks in the new X509_NAME code.
    
    Fix so new app_rand code doesn't crash 'x509' and move #include so it compiles
    under Win32.

Author: Mark J. Cox <mark@openssl.org>
Date:   Wed Nov 3 14:10:10 1999 +0000

    Fix assembler for Alpha (tested only on DEC OSF not Linux or *BSD).  The
    problem was that one of the replacement routines had not been working since
    SSLeay releases.  For now the offending routine has been replaced with
    non-optimised assembler.  Even so, this now gives around 95% performance
    improvement for 1024 bit RSA signs.

    Continued multibyte character support.
    
    Add a bunch of functions to simplify the creation of X509_NAME structures.
    
    Change the X509_NAME_entry_add stuff in req/ca so it no longer uses
    X509_NAME_entry_count(): passing -1 has the same effect.

    Always hash the pid in the first iteration in ssleay_rand_bytes,
    don't try to detect fork()s by looking at getpid().
    The reason is that threads sharing the same memory can have different
    PIDs; it's inefficient to run RAND_seed each time a different thread
    calls RAND_bytes.

    Use of DEVRANDOM must be #ifdef'ed (the #ifdef was commented out
    between SSLeay 0.8.1b and 0.9.0b with no apparent reason).
    If we *want* an error when DEVRANDOM is not defined (it always is with
    the current e_os.h) we should use #error.

    Initial support for MacOS.
    
    This will soon be complemented with MacOS specific source code files and
    INSTALL.MacOS.
    
    I (Andy) have decided to get rid of a number of #include <sys/types.h>.
    I've verified it's ok (both by examining /usr/include/*.h and compiling)
    on a number of Unix platforms. Unfortunately I don't have Windows box
    to verify this on. I really appreciate if somebody could try to compile
    it and contact me a.s.a.p. in case a problem occurs.

    Oops... forgot the other RSA_NULL patches...

commit 4a61a64f5004d4edb46e498c134b26746d9e5164
Author: Dr. Stephen Henson <steve@openssl.org>
Date:   Wed Sep 8 18:02:25 1999 +0000

    This is preliminary support for an "RSA null" cipher. Unfortunately when
    OpenSSL is compiled with NO_RSA, no RSA operations can be used: including
    key generation storage and display of RSA keys. Since these operations are
    not covered by the RSA patent (my understanding is it only covers encrypt,
    decrypt, sign and verify) they can be included: this is an often requested
    feature, attempts to use the patented operations return an error code.
    
    This is enabled by setting RSA_NULL. This means that if a particular application
    has its own legal US RSA implementation then it can use that instead by setting
    it as the default RSA method.
    
    Still experimental and needs some fiddling of the other libraries so they have
    some options that don't attempt to use RSA if it isn't allowed.

    SHA clean-up Intel assembler companion.
    
    I've chosen to nest two functions in order to save about 4K. As a result

    SHA clean-up and (LP64) tune-up.
    
    "Clean-up" stands for the fact that it's using common message digest
    template ../md32_common.h and sha[1_]dgst.c are reduced down to
    '#define SHA_[01]' and then '#include "sha_locl.h"'. It stands "(LP64)"
    there because it's 64 bit platforms which benefit most from the tune-up.
    The updated code exhibits 40% performance improvement on IRIX64
    (sounds too good, huh? I probably should double check if it's not
    some cache trashing that was holding it back before), 28% - on
    Alpha Linux and 12% - Solaris 7/64.

    Fix horrible (and hard to track down) bug in ssl23_get_client_hello:
    In case of a restart, v[0] and v[1] were incorrectly initialised.
    This was interpreted by ssl3_get_client_key_exchange as an RSA decryption
    failure (don't ask me why) and caused it to create a _random_ master key
    instead (even weirder), which obviously led to incorrect input to
    ssl3_generate_master_secret and thus caused "block cipher pad is
    wrong" error messages from ssl3_enc for the client's Finished message.
    Arrgh.

    BIO pairs (which is totally untested as of now, so I don't yet commit
    the actual source code, but reserve the numbers to avoid conflicts).

    Support for parsing of certificate extensions in PKCS#10 requests: these are
    used by things like Xenroll. Also include documentation for extendedKeyUsage
    extension.

    Backout the following change:
    
    | revision 1.109
    | date: 1999/06/24 19:39:23;  author: ulf;  state: Exp;  lines: +0 -1
    | Use the same CPU recogition method for FreeBSD 3 as for the other FreeBSD
    | versions. (The FreeBSD and FreeBSD-elf Configure entries were identical.)
    
    Because Ulf overlooked the ELF vs. a.out difference, i.e. the two entries were
    _NOT_ identical! This way OpenSSL 0.9.4 at least compiles again under FreeBSD
    2 and 3. For 0.9.5-dev I'll try to fix the stuff in a more general way to also
    allow FreeBSD 4 and other variants.

    I don't think this is a real showstopper.  Our internal verify procedure lacks
    even more and I consider this more a useful feature request than a release
    showstopper.

    New option "-crlf" to s_client and s_server which tells them to convert
    LFs into CRLFs when forwarding data from stdin to the TLS connection.
    This is necessary for properly talking HTTP.
    Because of the code freeze this change is by default disabled for now;
    without -DAPPS_CRLF, the code is exactly as before.

    Extra i386+gcc bn_div.c tune-up featuring inline division and saving
    the remainder left in %edx. Here is the resulting performance improvement
    matrix (improvement as a result of this *and* previous tune-up committed
    two days ago). The results were obtained by profiling the "div" part of
    the crypto/bn/bnspeed.c.
    
    CPU	BN_div	bn_div_words	overall	comment
    ------------------------------------------------------------------------
    PII	+16%	accumulated by	+2-3%	PII multiplies damn fast! Taking
    		inlining		multiplication out of the loop
    					didn't make too much difference.
    					Eliminating of the multiplication
    					involved in remainder calculation
    					is the major factor.
    
    Pentium	+45%	accumulated by	+7-9%	mull isn't that fast and replacing
    		inlining		multiplications with additions in
    					the loop has more visible effect:-)
    
    MIPS	+75%	+12%		+20-25%	In addition to the taking mults
    R10000					out of the loop (giving 12% in the
    					asm/mips3.s) three mults were
    					eliminated in BN_div.
    
    Alpha	+30%	+50%		+10-15%	Same as above. But remember that
    EV4					bn_div_words is a C implementation.
    					It takes 4 Alpha mults in C to do
    					the same thing as 1 MIPS mult in
    					assembler does. So the effect (50%)
    					is more impressive. But not the
    					overall one... Well, if Alpha
    					bn_mul_add would be implemented
    					in assembler overall improvement
    					would be closer to MIPS...

    Make the perl module compile and eliminate some of the warnings.
    Still doesn't work (the destructor on BIO and SSL is called immediately
    after creating the object. Why that??)

Date:   Sun Jul 18 22:39:45 1999 +0000

    Add optional (compile-time configurable) time to CRYPTO_mem_leaks output.
    This is much more helpful than the counter when doing tests with the library
    interactively.

Author: Bodo Möller <bodo@openssl.org>
Date:   Wed Jul 14 18:09:59 1999 +0000

    Judging from various messages on the OpenSSL mailing lists, HP-UX 10
    with cc (but not gcc) seems to work well with BN_LLONG; but -O4 is too
    much.

commit 924154d9f2d715b229077f594d928d7b2962814d
Author: Dr. Stephen Henson <steve@openssl.org>
Date:   Tue Jul 13 00:00:05 1999 +0000

    Eliminate a warning: BN_mod_inverse() returns a (BIGNUM *) and remove and
    unnecessary cast.

    Continues NASM support. This might work now. Its still experimental but it
    passes all the tests. Added documentation in INSTALL.W32.

    More NASM support code it still doesn't work but it doesn't work less than it
    didn't work before :-)

Author: Dr. Stephen Henson <steve@openssl.org>
Date:   Mon Jul 12 12:33:16 1999 +0000

    Beginnings of experimental support for NASM assembler. This is a free
    assembler for various X86 platforms including Win32. It can output object files
    that VC++ will tolerate so it could be used to provide assembly language support
    to Win32 without the need for MASM.
    
    This is preliminary stuff: it doesn't even work yet.

    With mingw32, use "long long" rather than "_int64" (the latter does

    The Mingw32 configuration entry was missing one colon (found by
    "Zot O'Connor" <zot@ZotConsulting.com>).
    Also, Windows probably does not need the warning about multi-threading.

    New function PKCS7_signatureVerify to allow the signing certificate to
    be explicitly stated with PKCS#7 verify.
    
    Also fix for util/mkerr.pl: if the -nostatic option is being used this will be
    for an external library so the autogenerated C file should include the
    header file as:
    #include "any/path/to/header.h"
    rather than the internal library form:
    #include <openssl/header.h>

    Convert the CONF library to use a typesafe stack: a STACK_OF(CONF_VALUE). It
    seemed like a good idea at the time... several hours later it was rather
    obvious that these are used all over the place making the changes rather

    Use same name in the definition as in the header file declaration :-/

    Unify DES library: ncbc_enc.c wasn't used, but its content was almost
    duplicated in cbc_enc.c (without IV updating) and in des_enc.c
    
    As pointed out by others on the openssl-dev list, des_cbc_encrypt (without
    IV updating; defined in cbc_enc.c) exists only for historical reasons:
    des_ncbc_encrypt should be used instead (and the caller does not have
    to manually update the IV).
    
    If des_cbc_enrypt is not needed for backwards compatibility, the
    definition of des_ncbc_encrypt should be put back into des_enc.c, and
    both cbc_enc.c and ncbc_enc.c can be deleted.
    
    If des_cbc_encrypt *is* needed for backwards compatibility, its behaviour
    obviously should not change (i.e., don't add IV updating).

    This is the main PKCS#5 v2.0 key generation function, it parses the ASN1
    structure and decides what key to generate (if any). Not currently added to
    the PBE algorithm list because it is largely untested.

    Older versions of SINIX C development system inherited a bug from

    Submitted by: Martin Kraemer

commit 7e701817234ff2be2a745fc63f32ccb5e874854c
Author: Bodo Möller <bodo@openssl.org>
Date:   Fri May 21 11:16:48 1999 +0000

    It was a very bad idea to use #include "../e_os.h" -- when this occurs
    in cryptlib.h (which is often included as "../cryptlib.h"), then the
    question remains relative to which directory this is to be interpreted.
    gcc went one further directory up, as intended; but makedepend thinks
    differently, and so probably do some C compilers.  So the ../ must go away;
    thus e_os.h goes back into include/openssl (but I now use
    #include "openssl/e_os.h" instead of <openssl/e_os.h> to make the point) --
    and we have another huge bunch of dependency changes.  Argh.

    Add a kludge :-(
    There were problems with putting e_os.h just into the top directory,
    because the test programs are compiled within test/ in the "standard"
    case in in their original directories in the makefile.one case;
    and in the latter symlinks may not be available.

    For Solaris with old gcc versions (that don't understand
    -mcpu=ultrasparc), don't silently step to solaris-sparc-gcc, which
    would unnecessarily use less efficient assembler code.
    Instead, use new configuration variant solaris-usparc-oldgcc;
    this also means that someone who reads the output of ./config will
    notice that it may be advantegeous to upgrade gcc.

    Fix various less obvious bugs in PKCS#7 handling: such as not zeroing
    the secret key before we've encrypted it and using the right NID for RC2-64.
    Add various arguments to the experimental programs 'dec' and 'enc' to make
    testing less painful.
    
    This stuff has now been tested against Netscape Messenger and it can encrypt
    and decrypt S/MIME messages with RC2 (128, 64 and 40 bit) DES and triple DES.
    
    Its still experimental though...

Author: Bodo Möller <bodo@openssl.org>
Date:   Sun May 16 12:26:16 1999 +0000

    Change type of various DES function arguments from des_cblock
    (meaning pointer to char) to des_cblock * (meaning pointer to
    array with 8 char elements), which allows the compiler to
    do more typechecking.  (The changed argument types were of type
    des_cblock * back in SSLeay, and a lot of ugly casts were
    used then to turn them into pointers to elements; but it can be
    done without those casts.)
    
    Introduce new type const_des_cblock -- before, the pointers rather
    than the elements pointed to were declared const, and for
    some reason gcc did not complain about this (but some other
    compilers did).

    and it certainly isn't if the point is just avoiding shadowing,
    which is apparently why the previous name "encrypt" was changed.)

    Add new -out option to asn1parse to allow the parsed data to be output.
    Fixed -strparse option: it didn't work if used more than once (this was due
    to the d2i_ASN1_TYPE call parsing a freed buffer). On Win32 the file wincrypt.h
    #define's X509_NAME and PKCS7_SIGNER_INFO causing clashes so these are #undef'ed

    The various character predicates (isspace and the like) may not be
    used with negative char values, so I've added casts to unsigned char.
    Maybe what really should be done is change all those arrays and
    pointers to type unsigned char [] or unsigned char *, respectively;
    but using plain char with those predicates is just wrong, so something
    had to be done.

    No actual change, but the cert_st member of struct ssl_session_st is now
    called sess_cert instead of just cert.  This is in preparation of further
    changes: Probably often when s->session->sess_cert is used, we should
    use s->cert instead; s->session->sess_cert should be a new structure
    containing only the stuff that is for just one connection (e.g.
    the peer's certificate, which the SSL client implementations currently
    store in s->session->[sess_]cert, which is a very confusing thing to do).

Date:   Tue May 4 08:56:51 1999 +0000

    Convert casted X509_INFO stacks to type-safe STACK_OF(X509_INFO).
    
    PS: Feel free to move the IMPLEMENT_STACK_OF(X509_INFO) from
        crypto/asn1/x_info.c to any other place where you think it fits better.
        X509_INFO is a structure slightly spreaded over ASN.1, X509 and PEM code,
        so I found no definitive location for IMPLEMENT_STACK_OF(X509_INFO).  In
        crypto/asn1/x_info.c it's at least now bundled with X509_INFO_new() and
        friends.

    testing they can finally go away...

    Delete the unnecessary ERR and ERRC lines in makefiles, add some functionality
    to error code script: it can now find untranslatable function codes (usually
    because the function is static and not defined in a header: occasionally because

    perl util/mkerr.pl -recurse -debug
    Also fixed some typos in crypto/pkcs12 that this found :-)
    Also tidy up some error calls that had to be all on one line: the old error
    script couldn't find codes unless the call was all on one line.

    prototypes to work (NB. the K&R prototypes can't be wiped just yet: they are
    still needed by the DEF generator...). I also ran the script with the -rewrite
    option to update all the header and source files.

    Fix a horrible BN bug in bn_expand2 which caused BN_add_word() et al to fail
    when they cause the destination to expand.
    
    To see how evil this is try this:
    
    #include <pem.h>
    main()
    {
    	BIGNUM *bn = NULL;
            int i;
    	bn = BN_new();
    	BN_hex2bn(&bn, "FFFFFFFF");
    	BN_add_word(bn, 1);
    	printf("Value %s\n", BN_bn2hex(bn));
    }
    
    This would typically fail before the patch.
    
    It also screws up if you comment out the BN_hex2bn line above or in any
    situation where BN_add_word() causes the number of BN_ULONGs in the result
    to change (try doubling the number of FFs).

    Second round of fixing the OpenSSL perl/ stuff. It now at least compiled fine
    under Unix and passes some trivial tests I've now added. But the whole stuff
    is horribly incomplete, so a README.1ST with a disclaimer was added to make
    sure no one expects that this stuff really works in the OpenSSL 0.9.2 release.
    Additionally I've started to clean the XS sources up and fixed a few little
    bugs and inconsistencies in OpenSSL.{pm,xs} and openssl_bio.xs.
    
    PS: I'm still not convinces whether we should try to make this
        finally running or kick it out and replace it with some
        other module....

    Add a useful kludge to allow package maintainers to specify compiler and other
    platforms details on the command line without having to patch the Configure
    script everytime: One now can use ``perl Configure <id>:<details>'', i.e.
    platform ids are allowed to have details appended to them (seperated by
    colons). This is treated as there would be a static pre-configured entry in
    Configure's %table under key <id> with value <details> and ``perl Configure
    <id>'' is called.  So, when you want to perform a quick test-compile under
    FreeBSD 3.1 with pgcc and without assembler stuff you can use ``perl Configure
    "FreeBSD-elf:pgcc:-O6:::"'' now, which overrides the FreeBSD-elf entry
    on-the-fly.
    
    (PS: Notice that the same effect _cannot_ be achieved by using
         ``make CC=pgcc ..'' etc, because you cannot override all
         things from there.)

    General source tree makefile cleanups: Made `making xxx in yyy...' display
    consistent in the source tree and replaced `/bin/rm' by `rm'.  Additonally
    cleaned up the `make links' target: Remove unnecessary semicolons, subsequent
    redundant removes, inline point.sh into mklink.sh to speed processing and no
    longer clutter the display with confusing stuff. Instead only the actually
    done links are displayed.

commit 15d21c2df4335f1cea72472b8e71a76d9004d38e
Author: Ralf S. Engelschall <rse@openssl.org>
Date:   Thu Feb 25 14:40:29 1999 +0000

    Add a bunch of SSL_xxx() functions for configuring the temporary RSA and DH
    private keys and/or callback functions which directly correspond to their
    SSL_CTX_xxx() counterparts but work on a per-connection basis. This is needed
    for applications which have to configure certificates on a per-connection
    basis (e.g. Apache+mod_ssl) instead of a per-context basis (e.g.
    s_server).
    
    For the RSA certificate situation is makes no difference, but for the DSA
    certificate situation this fixes the "no shared cipher" problem where the
    OpenSSL cipher selection procedure failed because the temporary keys were not
    overtaken from the context and the API provided no way to reconfigure them.
    
    The new functions now let applications reconfigure the stuff and they are in

    SSL_set_tmp_rsa_callback and SSL_set_tmp_dh_callback.  Additionally a new
    non-public-API function ssl_cert_instantiate() is used as a helper function

    Fix the cipher decision scheme for export ciphers: the export bits are *not*
    within SSL_MKEY_MASK or SSL_AUTH_MASK, they are within SSL_EXP_MASK.  So, the
    original variable has to be used instead of the already masked variable.

    Make `openssl x509 -noout -modulus' functional also for DSA certificates (in
    addition to RSA certificates) to match the behaviour of `openssl dsa -noout
    -modulus' as it's already the case for `openssl rsa -noout -modulus'.  For RSA
    the -modulus is the real "modulus" while for DSA currently the public key is
    printed (a decision which was already done by `openssl dsa -modulus' in the
    past) which serves a similar purpose.  Additionally the NO_RSA no longer
    completely removes the whole -modulus option; it now only avoids using the RSA
    stuff. Same applies to NO_DSA now, too.

    technique currently unsupported extensions can be generated if you know their
    DER encoding. Even if the extension is supported in future the raw extension
    will still work: that is the raw version can always be used even if it is a
    supported extension.

    Remember the cleanup

commit 155d7a0e1dcf225f635dc522b272606590112c58
Author: Ralf S. Engelschall <rse@openssl.org>
Date:   Wed Feb 10 08:26:08 1999 +0000

    First cut for a very conservative source tree cleanup:
    
    1. merge various obsolete readme texts into doc/ssleay.txt
       where we collect the old documents and readme texts.
    
    2. remove the first part of files where I'm already sure that we no longer need
       them because of three reasons: either they are just temporary files which
       were left by Eric or they are preserved original files where I've verified
       that the diff is also available in the CVS via "cvs diff -rSSLeay_0_8_1b"
       or they were renamed (as it was definitely the case for the crypto/md/
       stuff).
    
    We've still a horrible mess under crypto/bn/asm/.  There for a lot of files
    I'm sure whether we need them or not. So, when someone knows it better, feel
    free to cleanup there.

    and add an extra 'crl' parameter in the X509V3_CTX structure: guess
    what that's for :-) Fix to ASN1 macro which messed up
    IMPLICIT tag and add f_enum.c which adds a2i, i2a for ENUMERATED.

    New err_code.pl script to retain old error codes. This should allow the use
    of 'make errors' without causing huge re-organisations of files when a new
    code is added.

commit f6aed2cda608d6291225030fc259f207aac33732
Author: Dr. Stephen Henson <steve@openssl.org>
Date:   Sun Jan 17 00:13:14 1999 +0000

    Time to blow up the source tree :-) This is the beginning of support for
    GeneralizedTime. At several points PKIX specifies that GeneralizedTime can be
    used but OpenSSL doesn't currently support it. This patch adds several files
    and a bunch of functions.
    
    Of interest is the ASN1_TIME structure and its related functions. At several
    points certificates, CRLs et al specify that a time can be expressed as a
    choice of UTCTime and GeneralizedTime. Currently OpenSSL interprets this
    (wrongly) as UTCTime because GeneralizedTime isn't supported. The ASN1_TIME
    stuff provides this functionality.
    
    Still todo is to trace which cert and CRL points need an ASN1_TIME and modify
    the utilities appropriately and of course fix all the bugs.
    
    Note new OpenSSL copyright in the new file a_time.c. I didn't put it in
    a_gentm.c because it is a minimally modified form a_utctm.c .
    
    Since this adds new files and error codes you will need to do a 'make errors'
    at the top level to add the new codes.

    interface `openssl <command>', similar to `cvs <command>'.
    
    Notice, the openssl.cnf, openssl.c and progs.pl files were changed after a
    repository copy, i.e. they still contain the complete file history.

    What's now needed is a volunteer who wants to write down one or two sentences
    per API function to document it a little bit...

    Fix version stuff:
    
    1. The already released version was 0.9.1c and not 0.9.1b
    
    2. The next release should be 0.9.2 and not 0.9.1d, because
       first the changes are already too large, second we should avoid any more
       0.9.1x confusions and third, the Apache version semantics of
       VERSION.REVISION.PATCHLEVEL for the version string is reasonable (and here

commit 4098e89cbf1212e2fb796d64725f259ac680cb56

commit 03f8b042772ce5fe04b82e2933535d92ea56dce6

commit cb496082f8db564ac7c8054edf46a2a7dd5e7393
Author: Ralf S. Engelschall <rse@openssl.org>
Date:   Tue Dec 29 17:12:34 1998 +0000

    Import the first cut for manual pages.
    
    They are written in Perl's POD format for two reasons: First Perl is already
    needed for SSLeay and second, POD is easy to write and maintain _AND_ created
    nice looking NRoff manpages.
    
    The idea is to have three manual pages:
    
      openssl(1) ... The manpage for the `openssl' program (formerly ssleay)
      crypto(3) .... The manpage for crypto.h/libcrypto.a
      ssl(3) ....... The manpage for ssl.h/libssl.a
    
    The openssl(1) should be very similar to cvs(1), i.e.  it should document all
    commands in a compact way.  And I've even created the first cut for an
    overview of all 243 functions of the SSL API for ssl.pod. More to come...
